It is a one-billion-ton detector that uses the deep Antarctic ice as a medium to detect high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos that originate from decays of elementary particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. While these can be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos, astrophysical neutrinos at higher energies are key probes of the high-energy phenomena in the Universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos pass almost freely through even dense volumes of space and are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena. This award will fund the deployment of seven additional strings of photon sensors in the deep, clear Antarctic ice at the bottom center of IceCube, forming the IceCube Gen2 Phase 1 extension (""Phase 1"").  <br/><br/>The availability of a deep-ice drill presents several opportunities to enhance the existing IceCube infrastructure for research and education.  Deep ice drills will also allow for the possibility of deploying next-generation optical sensor technology prototypes within the existing IceCube operations framework at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, presenting new opportunities for training a new cohort of international students and young scientists throughout the instrumentation development, production, and field deployment.  The combination of astrophysics and the extreme polar climate attracts wide popular interest.<br/><br/>The new strings will use multi-PMT Digital Optical Modules (mDOMs), providing better directionality and more than double the photocathode area per module, at lower cost per unit area, than traditional IceCube DOMs. The mDOMs will be tightly integrated into the existing IceCube data acquisition framework, at marginal added long-term maintenance and operations expense. The new instrumentation will dramatically boost IceCube's performance at the 5 GeV energy scale, yielding over an order of magnitude more statistics than current samples, and enabling IceCube to perform the world's best measurement of tau neutrino appearance and the world's most stringent test of unitarity in the tau sector of the PMNS (Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata) matrix.  This matrix describes all known neutrino oscillation behavior, and deviations from unitarity would be evidence for new physics.  The strings will feature new calibration devices that would allow to better model the optical properties of the ice, reducing systematic uncertainties in the tau neutrino appearance measurement and enhancing IceCube's already strong contribution to multimessenger astrophysics via improved reconstruction of the direction of high energy cascade events for searches of point sources and enhanced identification of PeV-scale tau neutrinos. High energy tau neutrinos are essentially guaranteed to be astrophysical in origin, and they are a unique probe of neutrino oscillation physics over ultra-long baselines, providing powerful complementarity with Phase 1's atmospheric tau neutrino appearance measurement at lower energies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ICNO transformed one cubic kilometer of natural ice (at the depth from 1.4 to 2.4 km) into a giant Cherenkov emission detector, thus creating the world's largest neutrino detector above energies of approximately 10 GeV. Since its completion in 2010, the ICNO has detected neutrinos with energies spanning more than six orders of magnitude, from 10 GeV to beyond 5 PeV for the first time. (GeV = one billion electron volts; TeV = one trillion electron volts; and PeV = one quadrillion electron volts.) In 2017, the ICNO detected a neutrino with an energy of 290 TeV and its origin was pinpointed (again for the first time) to a blazar at a distance of about 3.5 million light years. This detection triggered an extensive campaign involving some twenty space- and ground-based telescopes that launched a new era in multi-messenger detection. <br/><br/>The mystique of the South Pole environment and the compelling science of IceCube are an alluring mix. Besides its extensive coverage in newspapers and publications popularizing science, IceCube has a significant presence on social media and the World Wide Web. In the next three years, focused projects include the continued development of an online video game, an activity for Zooniverse, and content for their successful high school MasterClasses. These activities will also contribute to the training of the next generation of scientists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with the IceCube technology development, astrophysical observations, and scientific analyses of the ICNO data.<br/><br/>The U.S. groups have established a solid and successful record of analyzing data from IceCube. This award will enable a unified analysis program which will maximize the impact of increasingly interconnected efforts. The synthesis of information from multiple astrophysical messengers is now providing a powerful new tool for probing the Universe. The highest energy messengers so far detected from the Universe are cosmic rays: high energy nuclei that are likely mostly protons. We do not yet know where or how they are accelerated to these extreme energies, but with the observation of a distant blazar in coincidence with the direction and time of a very high energy muon neutrino, neutrinos have now provided the first breakthrough in the resolution of this puzzle. The results reveal neutrinos as a key component of future multimessenger studies of the highest energy radiation reaching us from space. Thus, this award addresses and advances the science objectives and goals of the NSF's ""Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"" program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neutrinos are ghostlike neutral particles which can escape from dense regions in the Universe;   because they interact so weakly with other forms of matter, they arrive undeflected at Earth and thus tend to point directly back to the distant astrophysical sources that produced them.  The origin of these high-energy neutrinos recently discovered by IceCube is a new mystery in the field, and solving this problem would allow us not only to understand the microphysics and mechanisms of the sources but also to obtain important clues about an old mystery, the origin of cosmic rays.  More general, this discovery allows us to utilize neutrinos as probes of neutrino properties, dark matter, and other forms of fundamental physics.  A major goal of Professor Murase's research is to address these new and old problems through combinations of data coming not only from neutrinos but also from gamma rays, through theoretical calculations of particle production and propagation.  This research is interdisciplinary, including topics in astrophysics and particle physics and connecting theoretical ideas directly to experimental and observational data.  As a result, this research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science.  This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.   It will involve and thereby provide training to graduate students involved in this research, and key concepts of particle astrophysics will be disseminated among educators at high schools and community colleges.<br/><br/>More technically, one of the key ingredients in this research is the strategic multi-messenger approach in which predictions for different astroparticles (neutrinos, gamma rays, and cosmic rays) are confronted with data.  With sophisticated calculations including all relevant microphysical processes, the PI will test various models for the astroparticle origins and extract fundamental insights into the source physics of extreme astrophysical objects.  The multi-messenger connection among the measured neutrino, gamma-ray, and cosmic-ray backgrounds will be examined, and source classes of cosmic-ray accelerators that cannot be directly probed by gamma rays will also be studied.  The results of this study should be useful for the design of proposed next-generation neutrino and gamma-ray detectors."

Traditional astronomy has progressed from telescopes for visible light to include the full electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma-rays. Cosmic rays were discovered over a century ago, but the sources of these high energy particles from outer space remain mysterious. Recent discoveries by LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube have opened new windows on the Universe through gravitational waves and high energy neutrinos from deep space. Observations of these cosmic messengers have brought us into the era of Multi Messenger Astronomy (MMA). As one can imagine, multi-messenger observations with a network of a variety of detectors produce huge amounts of data with enormous complexity. Managing and analyzing the data pose a tremendous challenge to the science community, particularly those groups spread in EPSCoR states. This project will grow Big Data capability across six EPSCoR jurisdictions to address the challenge. Scientists with complementary skill sets will cooperate to make advances in MMA, beyond what could be done within a single jurisdiction. The project supports five early career faculty and trains postdoctoral scholars and college students. It also exposes secondary school students from underrepresented groups to IceCube and its Big Data challenges, which will help recruit young people into STEM fields and promote diversity and inclusion. The project?s vision is to establish a strong EPSCoR team that promotes new scientific ideas and innovates Big Data techniques to make discoveries in the era of MMA while preparing a high-tech workforce beneficial to all six participating EPSCoR states. <br/> <br/>IceCube is the world?s largest neutrino observatory serving Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (MMA). The cubic kilometer array of over 5000 optical sensors 2 km deep in the glacial ice at the South Pole and the detector array on the surface produce data at a rate of about 1 Terabyte/day. While the vast majority of the data are cosmic-ray events, among them are 10-100 neutrinos per year with energies between 10 TeV and 10 PeV. These events constitute the core of IceCube?s MMA program aiming to answer fundamental questions such as where extremely powerful cosmic accelerators reside, how they generate particles and light, and what they are made of. The next generation IceCube-Gen2 will increase the data volume by an order of magnitude and operate through 2050, to go beyond current energy limits with a much better accuracy. A full scale engagement of EPSCoR groups in IceCube and future MMA relies on overcoming impediments posed by limited infrastructure or human capital within a single jurisdiction. This project supports collaborative efforts among six EPSCoR jurisdictions to create new knowledge in three themes pivotal for IceCube?s MMA program. (1) Cosmic ray and gamma ray physics, with emphasis on separating particles from Galactic and extragalactic origins; (2) Address technical challenges in the development of radio instrumentation as part of IceCube-Gen2 by using data from the Askaryan Radio Array; (3) Develop a calibration and modeling strategy for the detection medium ice for IceCube-Gen2 by utilizing both optical and radio sensors. All these tasks will be driven by the ability to manage Big Data through advanced data science techniques in data throughput, calibration, simulation, analysis, modeling and hypothesis testing. The project is also committed to strengthen the STEM workforce across six EPSCoR jurisdictions. The workforce development plan mainly includes (i) mentoring five early career faculty, (ii) implementing a suite of programs to enhance the recruitment, retention and development of young scientists from secondary school through post-doctoral research, and (iii) developing a data science curriculum using IceCube data and research examples.

The combination of these new strings and the existing AMANDA strings will make IceCube an extremely powerful detector and the analysis of the data should be started as soon as possible. <br/><br/>This funding will enable the Maryland group to take a major role in producing results from this exciting new detector. The field of neutrino astronomy is on the threshold of a new era with the construction of the 1 cubic km IceCube neutrino detector. The observation of high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources will open a new window on the sky, which will provide new information on the acceleration mechanisms at work in these objects and insight into the nature of cosmic radiation. During the period of this award, the IceCube detector will reach the milestone of 1 cubic km-year of telescope data. To become the world's most sensitive detector, there are important performance characteristics that must be characterized and understood. This group will investigate how to improve the detector while they are publishing results of searches with an unprecedented sensitivity for the potential detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrino sources. The specific physics topics they plan to address are: 1) a search for astrophysical point sources of neutrinos using muons in the IceCube detector; 2) a search for WIMP particles using muon neutrinos in the IceCube detector; and 3) the development of techniques and reconstruction methods for identifying shower cascades in the IceCube detector as a way to measure electron and tau type neutrinos.<br/><br/>For Broader Impacts both the Maryland group and IceCube have been very active in exposing students and the general public to the excitement of the particle astrophysics field.

It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena. This award will fund this UCB group to use IceCube data to better characterize this astrophysical neutrino flux. They will measure the flux at higher energies than has currently been done, testing for the presence of a high energy cutoff. <br/><br/>IceCube's discovery of an astrophysical neutrino flux has attracted great attention from students at all levels and from the general public and garnered much media attention. This group will educate undergraduate and graduate students and postdocs who are attracted to this important question. The award will fund a broad spectrum of outreach activities targeted at the general public and younger students, through classroom and public presentations and popular writing.<br/><br/>This group's study will extend IceCube measurements of the energy spectrum both upward and downward in energy, through two searches. The first will use the data for a more accurate measurement of the neutrino flavor ratio: the relative proportion of electron, muon and tau neutrinos in the astrophysical flux. The second study will employ a fit to the energy and zenith angle distributions to separate conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrinos and astrophysical neutrinos. This fit should allow a sufficiently accurate measurement of the atmospheric pion:kaon ratio to constrain air shower models. It will also detect, for the first time, diffractive neutrino interactions, and will also provide constraints on parton distribution functions and nuclear shadowing at high energies."

The main goal of this project is to search for a signature in the energy-dependent composition of the primary cosmic rays of a transition from galactic cosmic rays to a higher energy population of particles from extra-galactic sources. While the primary mission of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory is to search for high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin by measuring events in the deep detector induced by neutrinos from below, the dominant signal in IceCube is due to downward events caused by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere. By looking for events from below, IceCube uses the Earth as a shield against this downward background. With its surface component IceTop, IceCube makes a 3-D air shower array with important potential for studying the downward cosmic rays. The novel feature of the IceCube/IceTop air-shower array is its large acceptance for events observed in coincidence. IceTop will use the ratio of the signal in the deep detectors to the signal on the surface to measure the relative concentration of different groups of nuclei in the primary cosmic radiation in an energy range not accessible to direct measurements with satellites because of the low intensity. The angular dependence of showers measured by IceTop alone and other features of the data are also sensitive to primary composition. This gives a complementary sensitivity to composition that in principle will remove some of the model-dependence inherent in the simulations used to interpret the data.

B. Price, Physics Dept., U. C. Berkeley<br/><br/> The Berkeley group led by P. B. Price has participated in the AMANDA high-energy neutrino astrophysics project since its inception in 1991. Beyond their participation in the construction of the growing IceCube observatory, this new grant will provide some support to the present group of 12 researchers as they analyze data flowing from IceCube. Here are a few of the topics they will study:<br/>   - Development of algorithms for analysis of electromagnetic cascades induced by electron neutrinos. They will be used to study high-energy cascades of both atmospheric and astrophysical origin.<br/>   - Using their new reconstruction algorithms, they will look for neutrinos produced by giant flares from powerful extragalactic sources of high energy neutrinos. <br/>   - They will exploit their method for increasing signal to noise by ""stacking"" data from particular families of point sources of high energy neutrinos with the expectation of seeing neutrinos from certain classes of active galaxies.<br/>   -  By means of a special ""slow-particle trigger"", they will search for hypothetical particles such as strangelets, supermassive magnetic monopoles, and Q-balls that will pass through much of the earth without significant slowing and that can be recognized by their slow speed (less than 1% the speed of light).<br/>   - Theorists have recently calculated that neutrinos with energy up to a trillion electron volts generated in core-collapse extragalactic supernovae may be detectable in IceCube for sources at distances within about 50 million light years of Earth. An unmistakable signal would be the detection of at least two such neutrinos from the same direction in the sky within a few seconds. Such a discovery would have great significance for astrophysics, gravitational physics, and relativity.<br/>The Berkeley group has led in inventing new devices for AMANDA and IceCube and in applying them to totally different topics at the forefront of science. The first such device was their laser-powered dust logger, which they have used to detect volcanic ash layers and climate-correlated dust concentrations, by means of which they discovered a causal relationship between large volcanic eruptions and abrupt climate change. By adding fluorescence channels to the dust logger, they created a biologger, with which they can detect various classes of microbes that contain molecules such as chlorophyll and tryptophan (an amino acid in all cells) whose fluorescence induced by the biologger allows them to study the history of microbial deposition and its possible correlation with climate and volcanism. A very recent example of the breadth of their interest is their realization that the explanation of the mysterious increase in phototube noise near the bottom of the IceCube strings is the light emitted by the glacial ice at great depths where the temperature is warm enough to allow shear of the flowing ice to develop, during which visible light and sound are produced. This poorly understood optical phenomenon of triboluminescence induced during jerky deformation of certain solids such as ice will be studied using IceCube data. There will no doubt be new spinoffs as they analyze ongoing IceCube data.<br/>"

However, their sources, nuclear composition and acceleration mechanism(s) remain unknown. Some possible sources include active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursters, and/or supernova remnants. In contrast to charged cosmic rays which bend in interstellar magnetic fields, the neutrinos that are expected to be produced in these accelerators travel in straight lines, so do point back to their sources. The IceCube observatory being built at the South Pole to search for these sources will soon reach 1 cubic km in volume. The accompanying 1 square km surface array (IceTop) detects air showers with energies above 300 TeV. Combining shower data with measurements of TeV muons from IceCube makes it possible to study the cosmic-ray composition. By using IceCube to veto events containing muons, it is also possible to identify photon-initiated showers. <br/><br/>This award will provide funds to study three topics pertaining to the origins and composition of cosmic rays: a search for a diffuse neutrino flux from the entire sky, a measurement of the transverse momentum (pT) spectrum of high pT muons in air showers, and a search for PeV photons from the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. During the three years of this grant, they will either observe extra-terrestrial neutrinos or set limits below the Waxman-Bahcall bound.  The pT spectrum of these muons can be calculated using perturbative QCD, thus avoiding the phenomenological models that are required in other composition studies. The group will continue contributing to IceCube Maintenance and Operations work in the areas of optical module simulation and calibration, detector verification and calibration and in Monte Carlo simulation production. <br/><br/>The Education and Outreach component will communicate this forefront research to students and the general public, through presentations at elementary through high schools and public lectures.

However, the usual tools of astronomy have difficulties gathering the requisite information at the highest energies. The universe is opaque to light with energy above 1015 eV if originating from outside of our galactic neighborhood, and charged cosmic rays do not carry directional information because of their deflection by galactic magnetic fields. The AMANDA detector, completed in 2000, was the first to search for astrophysical neutrinos from sources in the northern sky.  After 5 successful years of operation, it has now been incorporated into the IceCube, a new detector based on the AMANDA concept which is under construction at the South Pole.  AMANDA was designed to explore the highest energy bands of astronomy based on the detection of the neutrino, a particle with properties that complement those of the photon and charged cosmic rays.  At energies that overlap with mature fields of observational astronomy, multi-messenger astrophysics is possible.  IceCube continues this quest but with several important improvements.  Its energy resolution is expected to be good enough to confidently select neutrino events with energy between 1012-1015 eV. If the astrophysical neutrino signal is sufficiently strong to provide tens of events or more, IceCube will measure the energy spectrum, which is an important diagnostic when interpreting the data.   As a precursor to detailed analysis of data from IceCube strings, we intend to develop a new technique to better estimate the energy of the neutrino using powerful, new capabilities of the recently-installed AMANDA Transient Waveform Recorders (TWR) data acquisition system. TWR provides a complete digital record of the output from every AMANDA sensor embedded in the ice.  This beautifully complements the readout scheme of IceCube, which also plans to acquire digital records of detector signals, but with better fidelity. <br/><br/>Multi-messenger astronomy may be the most powerful method to decipher the physics of particle acceleration in Active Galaxies or  GRBs (Gamma Ray Bursts), which have been identified as possible sources of the highest energy cosmic rays. As a particle physics experiment detecting neutrinos with energies far beyond those produced at terrestrial accelerators, IceCube has the potential to uncover new physics based on high energy collisions between neutrinos and ordinary matter.  If GRBs emit a detectable flux of neutrinos, then the physics opportunities become even more exciting. For example, the weak equivalence principle can be tested by the contemporaneous measurement of the photon and neutrino arrival times.  <br/><br/>Because of the fundamental similarity in the data records between IceCube and AMANDA, we propose to develop and verify the accuracy of a new energy estimator that utilizes the additional information provided by TWR data and adapt it to include IceCube strings as they are installed.  We plan to use the energy information to provide more powerful tools to search for sources of high energy neutrinos and with luck, reveal the long-sought source of cosmic rays.<br/>"

Recent ICNO discoveries of cosmic high-energy neutrinos (some reaching energies close to and over 2.5 PeV) and oscillating atmospheric neutrinos in a previously unexplored energy range from 10 to 60 GeV became possible because of the ""state-of-the-art"" detector configuration, excellently supported infrastructure, and cutting-edge science analyses. The ICNO has set limits on Dark Matter annihilations, made precision measurements of the angular distribution of cosmic ray muons, and characterized in detail physical properties of the Antarctic 2.5-km thick ice sheet at South Pole. The discovery of high-energy cosmic neutrinos by IceCube with a flux at the level anticipated for those associated with high-energy gamma- and cosmic-ray accelerators brightens the prospect for identifying the sources of the highest energy particles."

Maryland Particle Astrophysics group has key leadership responsibilities on two of the major experimental efforts in the field: IceCube and Milagro. The IceCube Observatory is currently in the midst of a successful construction project at the Antarctic South Pole through an NSF Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction award. The IceCube detector has currently deployed 22 strings and by the start of this grant proposal period IceCube will have more than half the volume instrumented and be approaching one cubic kilometer-year of accumulated data. The observation of high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources will open a new window on the sky and will provide new information on the acceleration mechanisms at work in these objects and insight into the nature of cosmic radiation.<br/><br/>This proposal requests funds for the Maryland group to pursue the following physics goals with the IceCube detector for which they have had a major part in building: 1) search for astrophysical point sources of neutrinos using muons in IceCube, 2) search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using muon neutrinos in IceCube, 3) search for neutrinos coincident with gamma-ray bursts, 4) search for exotic particles such as monopoles and 5) search for high energy diffuse neutrinos of astrophysical origin. <br/><br/>Milagro has demonstrated that a water-Cherenkov shower detector is a powerful tool for looking at the TeV sky. Their survey of the galaxy revealed both new TeV sources (at least one with a spectrum extending to ~100 TeV) and strong diffuse emission. While detector operations will end this year, this proposal will allow them to continue analysis on the Milagro data. <br/><br/>IceCube and Milagro are strongly connected with other experiments in the field of Particle Astrophysics as they are part of a multi-messenger survey of the high energy sky. These experiments have a strong appeal both to the physics students and the general public and this group has an established track record in both public outreach and providing strong scientific and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. <br/>"

However, candidate theoretical models have been developed to make testable predictions about cosmic ray parameters that are observable at Earth.  In order to test these models, precise experimental measurements of multiple elemental spectra of cosmic rays are needed from a single experiment across the full energy range.  Using the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO), the IceCube group at Marquette University will provide the cosmic ray community with the first measurement of the elemental spectra from four distinct mass groups from the 'knee' to the 'ankle' in the cosmic ray energy spectrum using six years of IceCube data, new post-LHC simulations, novel methods for event selection, reduced systematic errors, new software algorithms, and new composition-sensitive parameters.  The group will share their research with the broader Milwaukee community to help bridge the racial and socio-economic divide in one of the most highly segregated cities in the United States.  Under this award, they will go out into the community to inspire the diverse local high school student population with fun and interactive ""household physics"" projects and bring diverse high school students back to Marquette to expose them to ""big science"" job opportunities through an IceCube Master Class.  In order to increase awareness among high school students of physics as a strong and viable career path for students from all backgrounds, this work will be framed by an intercultural competency program to train Marquette students to interact and connect with their local community empathetically, increase their own intercultural competency, and to build a culture of compassion within the physics department to sustain the participation of women and underrepresented minorities in physics.<br/><br/>The ICNO is the only detector that can presently perform this highly sought measurement that includes an entire decade in energy where four elemental spectra have never been measured. This will provide a new and coherent picture across the entire transition region from galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays.  Further, the Marquette IceCube group will simulate and fully optimize the detector response and array layout for a new prototype scintillator array being partially deployed at the South Pole this season (2018-19) to maximize its effectiveness for the cosmic ray analyses.  This new array is designed to mitigate the problem of snow drift and accumulation that threatens the effectiveness of the current ICNO surface array (IceTop).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The neutrino observatory, when complete, will consist of 4800 optical modules monitoring more than a cubic kilometer of ice for flashes of light characteristic of neutrino interactions.  The primary signature for a neutrino in IceCube will be an upward-moving event from a neutrino that has penetrated the Earth.  IceCube includes an array of detectors on the surface that serve as a partial veto for the down-going background of penetrating muons created by cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere above IceCube.  <br/>The surface array, called IceTop, will consist of 160 tanks of ice, each instrumented with two standard IceCube optical modules, to detect showers of secondary particles generated by interactions of high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere.  The analysis supported by this grant will focus on cosmic-ray events detected in coincidence by both the surface array and the deep detectors.    The ratio of deep signal to surface signal can be used to measure the relative fraction of heavy cosmic rays (e.g. nuclei of iron) to light cosmic rays (e.g. protons) in an energy region not accessible to direct observation with detectors carried above the atmosphere on balloons or spacecraft.  In particular we will look for a characteristic signature of a transition from sources inside our Milky Way Galaxy to extra-Galactic sources at higher energy.  We will also analyze data taken simultaneously by the Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment, looking for coincidences with IceTop as a way of extending our research to still higher energy.  As of 2006, IceCube has 9 strings of 60 detectors each in the ice, and there are 32 IceTop tanks in operation.

The recent first-ever observational evidence, by the IceCube Observatory, of high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources ushers in the long awaited era of neutrino astrophysics and promises to open a new window on the universe to provide information on the acceleration mechanisms at work in these sources and insight into the nature and source of cosmic radiation. <br/><br/>The IceCube Observatory was constructed at the U.S. Antarctic Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station and the detector deployment was completed in Dec 2010 with initial operation of the full detector commencing in Spring 2011.

To better understand the atmospheric and astrophysical nature of these neutrinos, precise modeling of atmospheric muons and neutrinos in the corresponding energy region is among the top priorities. In a related field, there have been discoveries regarding the origin and propagation of Galactic cosmic rays in past decades. One key question concerns the transition to cosmic rays of extragalactic origin at ultrahigh energies. Answering this question requires reliable measurements of both the energy and mass composition of cosmic ray primary particles between 10^15 eV (PeV) and 10^18 eV (EeV). This group will develop new analysis methods for better determining the energies and directions of these very high energy particles based on the data obtained from the IceCube Observatory. The broader impacts of this project will be both educational and synergistic. This award will provide funds for the support of a graduate student and some travel.<br/><br/>With its surface array IceTop, IceCube provides unique data for the study of cosmic rays in the entire Galactic to extragalactic transition region and the atmospheric muons and neutrinos induced by them.

Just what percentage of the population is light, and what percentage is heavy, is still under active study. Because cosmic rays are charged and their trajectories bend in magnetic fields, they do not point back to their origin; determining the origin of these particles is an unsolved problem with a 100-year heritage. Features in the energy spectrum (such as kinks, bumps, or changes in slope) are important clues, thought to be related to changes in composition and origin.

This project first focuses on improving the reconstruction of cosmic ray air showers with IceTop, especially at high energies where current reconstruction techniques are underperforming. It will study snow attenuation, the curvature and fluctuations of the shower front, and the separate treatment of coincident and isolated signals in the detector. The project includes simulations to study how different hadronic interaction models impact the signals seen in IceTop.

For more than two decades, deviations from the Standard Model three-neutrino expectation have been observed in short baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. Most commonly, new-physics explanations introduce a single sterile neutrino in addition to the three active flavors, electron, muon, and tau, called a 3+1 model. However, within this model, the anomalies and relevant null results are not self-consistent. Given these discrepancies, if all, or even some, of the signals are due to new physics, then the underlying physics must be more complicated than a 3+1 model. Resolving the situation has become a high priority for the field. Unlike many beyond-Standard-Model searches, this is a case where the parameter space we must probe is relatively well-understood. This coordinated IceCube and IsoDAR program, which is developed as part of this project, will explore this space in depth, and offer new approaches involving all three flavor signatures -- even tau-neutrinos.<br/><br/>This PI has developed two ongoing, unusually-impactful programs. The first is the $100 desktop muon counter, which has been featured in the press.

The greatest intellectual merit of constructing a neutrino detector lies in the mysteries yet-to-be-discovered with a new technology operating in a new energy regime. RICE (Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment) has primary goals similar to the larger AMANDA experiment - both seek to measure high-energy neutrinos by detection of Cherenkov radiation produced their interaction with the matter. Whereas AMANDA is optimized for detection of penetrating TeV muons, RICE is designed to detect compact electromagnetic cascades initiated by higher energy (PeV-scale) electrons, which produce broadband Cherenkov radiation. Fortuitously, the field attenuation length at such radio wavelengths exceeds 1 km. For 1 PeV, radio detection of cascades becomes more efficient than optical-based techniques; at such high energies, the sum of backgrounds from all other sources are expected to be smaller than signals by 10-100. This proposal is to co-deploy RICE radio receivers in the IceCube holes, thereby scaling up the sensitivity to neutrinos by at least two orders of magnitude, at minimal cost. Encouraged by support from the IceCube collaboration, the project will instrument the radio array for coincident (RICE + IceCube) electromagnetic cascade detection. Fast hardware (to be installed in 2003-2004) will allow microsecond time-scale elimination of the surface anthropogenic background, which has dominated triggers in the past. RICE data from the last four years have allowed the most detailed study of in situ radio detection systematics thus far, as presented in two recent publications on the electrodynamics of the expected radio frequency pulse, and two publications on RICE simulation and calibration and limits on the neutrino flux. By deploying three radio receivers per hole, it will also be possible to conduct world-class, in situ radio-glaciology measurements, in addition to astrophysics. The results on the first in situ measurements of the polar ice dielectric constant are currently being prepared for journal submission. Maximizing economy has required that much of the workload falls on students. Currently, half of the current RICE authors are undergrads; three RICE undergrads have been recipients of prestigious Goldwater Scholarships, five RICE undergrads have traveled to the South Pole since the first deployments in 1999-2000.

With this award the Georgia Tech group will use HAWC and IceCube data to study high-energy gamma ray and neutrino emission from GRBs. The HAWC observatory, currently under construction in Mexico, will be at an order of magnitude more sensitive to GRB emission than previous ground-based instruments. The group will play an important role in the design and construction of HAWC, particularly in the electronics and software related to the study of GRBs. The HAWC data may teach us about the highest energy particles accelerated by GRBs and may reveal details about the relativistic jets that power a GRB.  IceCube is a high-energy neutrino telescope in operation at the South Pole. The group will use data collected by DeepCore, a low energy extension of IceCube, to search for transient bursts of neutrinos.  To enhance DeepCore's sensitivity they will collect data with a new, looser vetoing technique.  They will study the connection between core collapse supernovae (SNe) and GRBs and the hypothesis that many core collapse SNe have hidden or choked jets. The discovery of neutrinos in coincidence with core collapse SNe would prove that they and GRBs are part of continuous class of astrophysical objects.   <br/><br/>Broader Impact:  The Georgia Tech group will report HAWC observations promptly to enable multi-messenger follow up with neutrinos (notably IceCube/DeepCore), gravitational waves, X-rays, etc., thus extending the scientific range of the experiments. In collaboration with CEISMC at Georgia Tech the PI and members of his group will continue their program of lectures and hands on demonstrations in the areas of particle and nuclear physics and astrophysics. Demonstrations include devices such as a cloud chamber and a Geiger counter. The high schools targeted have a large Hispanic population, for which the PI, born in Latin America, has a natural connection."

They may also produce gravitational radiation.  These ""messengers"" carry details of the energetics and physical conditions in these sources.  The Astrophysical Multimessenger Observatory Network (AMON) aims to discover new particle astrophysics phenomena by merging the world's leading multimessenger observatories into a single data system for the first time.  The facilities to be linked by AMON observe high-energy neutrinos (the IceCube and ANTARES Neutrino Observatories), the strongly-interacting nuclei observed as cosmic rays (the Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory), and in future phases, the oscillations in the fabric of space-time manifested as gravitational waves (the Advanced LIGO and VIRGO gravitational-wave detectors). These are complemented by current and next-generation gamma-ray facilities, including the Swift and Fermi satellites and the HAWC gamma-ray observatory.  Over the three year award period, the PIs will construct a prototype AMON network with the scientific goal of discovering the first jointly-emitting gamma-ray and high-energy neutrino sources.  In conjunction with the AMON project, the PIs will also initiate and run ""AstroTxt,"" an applied educational experience that will involve central Pennsylvania middle and high school students directly in real-time AMON operations. <br/><br/>AMON will assemble the first terabyte-scale multimessenger database and develop tools for data exchange and real-time correlation analysis, establishing a superior level of interoperability.  This new and transparent sharing of data promises significant scientific advances:  Data from individual facilities that in isolation cannot be interpreted as the detection of an astrophysical source, may achieve a higher level of significance in a joint coincident analysis of data from multiple participating observatories.  Each candidate astrophysical signal will be packaged as an electronic AMON Alert and distributed to a network of follow-up facilities for counterpart searches and characterization.  Identification of an x-ray, optical, or radio counterpart will serve to confirm the astrophysical nature of an event and enable a broad range of detailed studies, including distance or redshift measurement, using traditional astronomical techniques."

The combination of these search channels is anticipated to enhance the discovery potential of all-flavor diffuse neutrino flux searches. Once a signal is observed, the information about the neutrino flavor composition at Earth can be used to study the initial flavor composition of these fluxes at their source. The group will also study directional cascade reconstruction to search for up- and down-going neutrino-induced high energy cascades.

This project is aimed at advancing the theoretical understanding of such aspects of physics beyond the standard model and at maximizing the amount of information that can be obtained from the experimental data by considering new analysis frameworks and exploring new connections between different phenomena. The project integrates an educational outreach program aimed at high school teachers. Neutrino experiments are a large component of both the intensity and cosmic frontiers of exploration in particle physics. The research covers theoretical aspects of several different science topics that can be studied using large neutrino detectors. More specifically: The PI will work on optimizing the next generation of neutrino experiments and developing a better framework for understanding the data and its implications for theoretical models. An extensive study of atmospheric neutrino oscillations in present and future large neutrino detectors will be performed, extending the PIs investigation of such oscillations in the Ice-Cube Deep Core detector. Topics to be explored include: non-standard neutrino interactions in matter; tests for the existence of new species of sterile neutrinos; the value of the atmospheric neutrino data, which covers a large range of energies and propagation distances, in combination with precise neutrino data from long baseline neutrino experiments and other observations. Supernova neutrinos from a galactic explosion would be observed in very large numbers by present and future neutrino detectors. The PI will explore possible analytic solutions to the flavor oscillation equations for streaming neutrinos in a supernova, especially the effects of neutrino-neutrino scattering, by employing methods used to study collective effects in other fields of science. Such solutions could help in simplifying the very involved numerical simulations of supernova neutrino propagation and thus lead to a better understanding of the information that can be obtained from a supernova neutrino detection. The project will address the potential for indirect dark matter detection in large neutrino detectors. Investigation of its value in the context of a general theoretical framework and in connection with other dark matter searches and potential discoveries is also proposed. High energy physics, astrophysics and cosmology and the questions they are trying to address are very exciting and capture the interest of a larger public, providing excellent outreach opportunities.

Neutrons detected by such monitors are byproducts of nuclear interactions of cosmic rays (predominantly protons and helium nuclei) with Earth's atmosphere. South Pole is a unique location at high altitude and low geomagnetic cutoff rigidity. This installation is the lynchpin of the worldwide neutron monitor network at low energies and the primary link to spacecraft measurements at much lower energies. Central to the research is the need to understand the detector response to the radiation environment of the South Pole, particularly to determine the cause of a peculiar secular decline in cosmic rays intensity at South Pole throughout the ~50-year operating period of the neutron monitor. Understanding this decline is important because cosmic rays produce radionuclides such as Beryllium-10 that become trapped in the ice and are used to determine ice-core sample ages and precipitation levels over the Earth's Polar Regions. A full understanding of the production rate is vital to interpreting these data.<br/><br/>Recent opening of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at South Pole, specifically the IceTop air shower array, has increased the value of neutron observation. In addition to its primary function as an extensive air shower detector, IceTop is highly sensitive to the intensity and spectrum of cosmic rays of energy formerly accessible only to the neutron monitors. IceTop and the neutron monitor are highly complementary to each other as the former is more sensitive in an absolute sense but responds to somewhat higher energy particles than does the monitor. IceTop responds primarily to the electronic component of the secondary particles whereas the neutron monitor responds primarily to the hadronic component. Together the detectors can determine not only the spectra but also the element composition of the primary particles.<br/><br/>Solid science, collaborative effort, international partners, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve education and outreach goals. Operation of the neutron monitor at South Pole will become an undergraduate activity at University of Wisconsin-River Falls. Providing undergraduate and two-year college students with research experiences will allow students to make meaningful contributions to cutting-edge science.<br/><br/>Neutron monitor data are broadly employed by other research groups, with applications in cosmic ray research, solar-terrestrial relations, space weather, climatology, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and magnetospheric physics. Neutron monitors play a direct role in forecasting and specifying solar wind disturbances and in providing Ground Level Enhancement alerts relevant to the transpolar aviation. Improving the capability to forecast and characterize major space weather events has direct societal benefit."

RICE has historically been calibrated using in-ice radio transmitters; however, these transmitters suffer additional drawbacks of having signal geometry distinctly different from the neutrino-induced air showers produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere. These extensive air showers (EAS) currently observable both via their particle flux at the South Pole surface with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory IceTop detectors, and also the flux of penetrating muons reaching IceCube 2-km below. Such air showers will also produce two radio wave signals ? one at long-wavelengths in-air due to the EAS charged particle flux undergoing geomagnetic separation, and the other in-ice produced when that particle flux impacts the surface, resulting in a Cherenkov signal identical to that expected for in-ice neutrinos. It is proposed to redirect the former RICE trigger scheme for both 'in-air' and 'in-ice' EAS, taking advantage of the existing air-shower detection capabilities offered by the combination of the IceCube and IceTop detectors. Coincident detection with the next-generation in-ice digital radio module hardware will allow complete tracking of air shower signals from several hundred meters above the ice surface to hundreds of meters below. This would establish the constant calibration beam upon which future in-ice radio detection devices can be further developed, and which must be quantified for proposed surface neutrino-detection arrays with no up-down discrimination, leaving them susceptible to fake signals from air showers.

The AMANDA uses natural 1.5-mile deep Antarctic ice as a Cerenkov detector. The telescope's effective area has reached 40,000 sq. m for the detection of point sources of cosmic neutrinos and exceeds 50,000 sq. m for gamma ray bursts at all zenith angles. The AMANDA detector has now operated for more than three years in its final configuration of 677 optical modules on deployed 19 strings. The detector collects approximately 4 terabytes of data yearly. These data are filtered at a high level at the South Pole and transmitted back to UW-Madison at a rate of about 3 gigabytes per day via the geostationary satellite systems and stored for further analysis and distribution to the AMANDA collaboration. Also stored are simulation data needed to analyze the experimental data. Presently 6 TB of AMANDA data is held online on large high availability RAID arrays. To enhance the quality of data management UW-AMANDA is taking the lead in adapting the DIF metadata standard to astrophysics. The scientific analyses in AMANDA can be classified as follows: (a) Atmospheric muon flux: the cosmic ray muon flux has been used to do a precision calibration of the detector with high statistics; (b) Atmospheric neutrinos: AMANDA's performance has been calibrated by reconstructing upward-going muons produced by atmospheric muon neutrinos. The detector, in steady operation, collects roughly four neutrinos per day using fast on-line analysis software. The atmospheric neutrino spectrum is now measured up to 100 TeV; (c) Cascades produced by the secondary electromagnetic and hadronic showers initiated by electron and tau neutrinos. The flux level is approaching where the much lower atmospheric neutrino fluxes should be observed, as well as the prompt flux from the decay of heavy quarks can be measured; (d) Search for point sources of cosmic neutrinos such as supernova remnants, mini-quasars, active galaxies; (e) Search for a diffuse flux of cosmic neutrinos; (f) Search for gamma ray bursts; and (g) Extremely high energy events from cosmological remnants or mini-black holes, magnetic monopoles, cold dark matter particles. The UW plays a major role in all analyses except for the last one. With the University of Delaware, the UW group determined that the fraction of heavy elements in the cosmic ray flux increases with energy in the region of the knee, by studying the muon response of AMANDA to air showers detected by the SPASE array deployed at the surface. The UW AMANDA group has pioneered many of the programs that are now part of the extensive IceCube education and outreach program including the Science in the Ice course that involves high school teachers and their students, as well as participants in the TEA (Teacher Experience in Antarctica) program."

In particular, GECo will work on studying the cross correlation between LIGO GWs and neutrino detections from the IceCube observatory in the South Pole. Improved detectors are critical for seeing more of the cosmos with higher fidelity while astrophysically informed data analysis enable insight beyond the state of the art of Today. The aLIGO detectors were built to provide insight on elusive cosmic objects from black-holes to neutron-stars.  Therefore GECo's program aims to improve the odds of discovering neutron-star containing binary systems and enhance the value of each discovery via enhanced detector and data analysis performance.

At the root of new discoveries, there will be a multifaceted interplay between improved instruments, advanced understanding of the data, and innovative data analysis approaches relying on a comprehensive mesh of cosmic messengers. GECo will focus on the astrophysical, observational and experimental foundations of synergetic multimessenger campaigns, the firm base of new discoveries. GECo will utilize astrophysical as well as data structure priors to enhance the fidelity of the detections and to enable the confident detection of cosmic signals yet undetected. GECo aims to investigate multimessenger information, with special attention to neutrino counterparts and to enhance electromagnetic follow-up capabilities with low-latency coincident neutrino information. Multimessenger approaches have the potential to enhance the number of detectable sources as more distant, and abundant, cosmic events can become accessible. GECo also aims to investigate gravitational wave searches incorporating astrophysical priors on the properties of binary systems that can potentially enhance search sensitivity. GECo aims to contribute to the proper operation of advanced LIGO, to characterize the performance of mission critical detector subsystems, and to prepare in-depth reports to support exceptional gravitational wave candidates."

Neutrinos are unique astronomical messengers which may provide critical information in identifying sources of cosmic rays and the physics processes out of which they are born. Neutrinos retain their directional information through magnetic fields and point back to their source. They can travel long distances from their sources without significant attenuation. The observation of neutrinos from an astrophysical source would be unambiguous evidence for hadronic acceleration, since cosmic proton accelerators are expected to produce cosmic rays, gamma rays and neutrinos with similar luminosities. Recent data from HiRES and AUGER seem to support the existence of the ""GZK cutoff"", the modification of the cosmic ray spectrum due to the photoproduction effect and hence one expects a flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos from the charged pion decays.<br/><br/>Because of the low flux at extremely high energies, novel techniques must be employed to build a cost effective array large enough to gain a statistically meaningful number of events at GZK energies. One such technique uses the Askaryan effect where the Cerenkov radiation in the radio frequencies (RF) is used to measure the energy and direction of the showers that result from the neutrino interactions. This award provides funds to continue research and development towards a detector to sense the RF emission from neutrino induced showers in RF transparent media such as ice.  Such an RF sensor at the South Pole would significantly extend the flux sensitivity of the IceCube array. <br/><br/>The Broader Impacts of this project include involvement in public outreach, working to expand U.

These two telescopes provide astronomers in the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile with access to the whole sky. Using modern instruments on each telescope, astronomers are able to study everything from asteroids, comets and nearby planets, to huge super-bright stars and distant galaxies.  Plans are now under way at Gemini to prepare each telescope for a new decade of discovery. Astrophysics in the 2020s will be revolutionized by ""Multi-Messenger Astronomy"", an exciting new field that uses gravitational waves and high-energy particles, as well as ordinary everyday light, to study some of the most exotic objects and explosive events in the Universe. Facilities like NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), the NSF/University of Wisconsin IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory, and NSF's latest telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will detect these ""messengers"", changing the way we study the Universe. In support of these remarkable new observatories, Gemini will develop new computer software and new optics hardware so that astronomers can study each new discovery quickly and in high detail. In addition to making remarkable discoveries and doing amazing science, Gemini is also a leader in education, public information and outreach activities. Gemini staff bring science to the communities in both Hawai'i and Chile through unique programs such as Journey through the Universe, AstroDay, and Viaje al Universo. With this new award they will extend their reach by developing a Planetarium show that will help the public better understand Multi-Messenger Astronomy. Gemini will also run workshops for educators and communicators so that they too can explain the exciting new discoveries that will surely be made by LIGO, IceCube, LSST and Gemini over the coming decade. <br/><br/>Gemini has proposed a challenging though very exciting program of cutting-edge development activities that are in line with NSF's strategic goals and those of its international partners in the Gemini Observatory. The enhancement of existing Adaptive Optics (AO) capabilities at Gemini-S and particularly Gemini-N on Maunakea, one of the best sites in the world for high-resolution imaging, will ensure that the observatory remains competitive in the 2020s, in the run-up to the commissioning of 30-to-40 meter class telescopes at the end of the coming decade.  Wide-field AO-corrected infrared imaging at Gemini will complement a similar capability on the James Webb Space Telescope, which will hopefully be executing its prime mission in the 2020s. At the same time, in collaboration with other national facilities, Gemini staff will develop and mature software aimed specifically at preparing Gemini for time domain and multi-messenger astronomy in a decade when LIGO and LSST will drive many of the most exciting science discoveries. The proposal's goal of ensuring that Gemini is the best positioned public 8-meter class facility for follow-up activities is clearly consistent with the wishes of the observing communities at home and abroad.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While visually spectacular, less than 1% of the energy in the supernova is released as visible light or as kinetic energy in the surrounding environment.  Most of the energy from the supernova is released in neutrinos, which are small particles that only interact weakly with matter.  The neutrino emission from a supernova precedes the emission of visible light by a few minutes up to many hours.  Detecting the first neutrinos from a supernova therefore provides an early alert to trigger further observations.  The SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) is a network of neutrino detectors around the world designed to provide automated early alerts for supernovae in our galaxy.  While rare, a galactic supernova would provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of core-collapse supernova, as well as the properties of neutrinos.  The early alerts from SNEWS will enable observations of the earliest phases of the supernova for physicists and astronomers around the world.  The SNEWS project works to engage amateur astronomers, who may play an important role in optical observations of supernova, and to involve them in the science of supernova.  <br/><br/>SNEWS involves neutrino detectors around the world: Super-K, Large Volume Detector, IceCube, Borexino, KAMLand, and Daya Bay.  If any of the participating experiments finds a burst of events, it sends a datagram to the central SNEWS computer located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, with a backup located in Bologna.  If a coincidence is found within 10 seconds, a supernova alert will be sent out.  SNEWS has been operational since 1998, and has been running in a fully-automated mode since 2005 with near-100% up-time. This award will provide funds to maintain the SNEWS system, support undergraduate researchers participating in the project, and expand connections to the astronomical community."

In addition, the technology addresses societal needs, including advancements in medical imaging and nuclear security. In the medical application, the same core technology can enable the production of cost-effective ultrasensitive whole-body-enclosing medical scanners for new preventive low-dose cancer screening of a symptom-free population. For nuclear security applications, this technology can enable widespread and cost-effective detection of illicit fissionable and radioactive materials. <br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a novel particle detector, designed initially for cosmic neutrino radiation.  The extreme environment calls for changes to existing detector technology, both in terms of component design and systems engineering. Pairs of modified photosensors will need to be packed into each detector unit.  Other engineering challenges include the high-voltage supply architecture, as well as the optical path.  The entire system needs to be engineered to operate at -70 degrees C.

Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high-energy gamma rays.  This award supports scientists at Michigan State University doing research with HAWC.  In addition to activities in support of HAWC operations, the group will use HAWC data to explore the origin and acceleration of particles in extreme physical environments.  They will also use HAWC observations to search for gamma-ray counterparts of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.  The group will engage in education and public outreach activities, including installing a HAWC exhibit at the Michigan State University Abrams Planetarium.<br/><br/>HAWC is a wide field of view, continuously operating observatory.  Unlike more traditional ground-based telescopes that point at a small region of sky on clear nights, HAWC has the ability to study very extended regions of gamma-ray emission and to nearly-continuously monitor time-varying phenomena.  The Michigan State University group will capitalize on these abilities by compiling a catalog of time-varying gamma-ray sources and looking for correlations with high-energy neutrino events recorded by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and lower energy gamma-ray emission recorded by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope.  The group will also conduct a search for dark matter signals coming from the extended halo around the Galactic Center.

These ""astrophysical"" neutrinos have been observed at Earth already and many more observations are expected in the near future. In this context, the theoretical research to be performed by the PI will play an important role in understanding the experimental data and will allow for new insights regarding the fundamental processes that take place in stars and the specific role played by the neutrino properties. In addition, this state-of-the-art research project will provide excellent opportunities for the training of students. <br/><br/>A major area of investigation in particle astrophysics concerns the physics of O(10) MeV neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae that presents a strategic opportunity for upcoming neutrino detectors. It is planned to study the potential of these detectors to measure the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos  from a galactic supernova burst, with minimal theoretical priors, to distinguish different oscillation scenarios. Hours before a star becomes a supernova, neutrinos from the Silicon burning phase might be detectable. The flux of these neutrinos will be modeled in detail, using a new calculation method that includes the nuclear beta processes. Supernova neutrinos can also be detected in the form of diffuse flux from the cosmic population of supernovae. The study of this flux will be revitalized in the light of recent developments, with focus on detectability, and on the potential to measure important physical quantities from the diffuse flux.  At higher energies, E ~ TeV - PeV, extraterrestrial neutrinos were discovered in 2013. This project considers star formation as a possible origin of these neutrinos. Positional coincidences of the neutrino data with known high-star formation regions will be studied quantitatively, and theory models of neutrino production in these regions will be developed.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Division of Physics and the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate of Mathematical & Physical Sciences."

Neutrons detected by such monitors are byproducts of nuclear interactions of cosmic rays (predominantly protons and helium nuclei) with Earth's atmosphere. South Pole is a unique location at high altitude and low geomagnetic cutoff rigidity. This installation is the lynchpin of the worldwide neutron monitor network at low energies and the primary link to spacecraft measurements at much lower energies. Central to the research is the need to understand the detector response to the radiation environment of the South Pole, particularly to determine the cause of a peculiar secular decline in cosmic rays intensity at South Pole throughout the ~50-year operating period of the neutron monitor. Understanding this decline is important because cosmic rays produce radionuclides such as Beryllium-10 that become trapped in the ice and are used to determine ice-core sample ages and precipitation levels over the Earth's Polar Regions. A full understanding of the production rate is vital to interpreting these data.<br/><br/>Recent opening of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at South Pole, specifically the IceTop air shower array, has increased the value of neutron observation. In addition to its primary function as an extensive air shower detector, IceTop is highly sensitive to the intensity and spectrum of cosmic rays of energy formerly accessible only to the neutron monitors. IceTop and the neutron monitor are highly complementary to each other as the former is more sensitive in an absolute sense but responds to somewhat higher energy particles than does the monitor. IceTop responds primarily to the electronic component of the secondary particles whereas the neutron monitor responds primarily to the hadronic component. Together the detectors can determine not only the spectra but also the element composition of the primary particles.<br/><br/>Solid science, collaborative effort, international partners, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve education and outreach goals. Operation of the neutron monitor at South Pole will become an undergraduate activity at University of Wisconsin-River Falls. Providing undergraduate and two-year college students with research experiences will allow students to make meaningful contributions to cutting-edge science.<br/><br/>Neutron monitor data are broadly employed by other research groups, with applications in cosmic ray research, solar-terrestrial relations, space weather, climatology, atmospheric physics, geophysics, and magnetospheric physics. Neutron monitors play a direct role in forecasting and specifying solar wind disturbances and in providing Ground Level Enhancement alerts relevant to the transpolar aviation. Improving the capability to forecast and characterize major space weather events has direct societal benefit."

However, it is not understood what kinds of stars give rise to these events, nor what is the exact mechanism whereby they produce gamma-rays, neutrinos and charged cosmic rays, nor how frequently or how far back in time they occur. AGNs, on the other hand, are suspected of harboring giant black holes, more massive than millions of suns, and are known to accelerate jets of electrons, which produce radio waves, light and ultra-high energy gamma rays. However, it is unclear if these jets also contain protons and neutrons, like some giant neutron gun, which would also entail highly penetrating neutrinos. Both ultra-high energy protons and neutrinos are targets for giant cosmic ray and neutrino telescopes being built by NSF in Argentina and in the South Pole, which will probe energies millions of times higher than any ever achieved in Earth laboratories. This is uncharted territory, and we need to know the theoretical ranges of possible results. A comparison of theoretical models with these experiments is imperative, in order to test the validity of current ideas (or the need for new ones) about how our Universe functions.

MMA was galvanized when the collision of two neutron stars (labeled GW/GRB 170817A) was detected last year by multiple large science instruments including the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), its sister gravitational wave observatory VIRGO in Italy, NASA's Fermi gamma-ray telescope in space, and many other optical and radio telescopes world-wide. These multiple measurements of just one event improved our estimate of the speed of gravity to phenomenal precision, confirmed that neutron star mergers are the origin of the heavier atomic elements, and gave us a measurement of the radii of neutron stars to about one kilometer accuracy. Over the next decade, LIGO will identify dozens of such events per year. In parallel, the NSF-supported IceCube neutrino observatory at the U.S. South Pole Station and other neutrino and cosmic ray observatories are detecting high-energy cosmic rays from distant cosmological sources; and the new NSF-led Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and upcoming radio astronomy facilities will come online to survey the skies with unprecedented speed and depth throughout the Universe. While each kind of astronomical observing system will bring fascinating new discoveries, it is in their combination - through MMA - that transformative new insights into some of the most fundamental questions about the Universe can be realized: What is the nature of the highest-energy cosmic particle accelerators? What are the properties of cold and hot bulk matter at supra-nuclear densities?

In a minority of the galaxies their observed light is dominated by a single source: the supermassive black hole located at their very center. In these galaxies, the black hole feeds on material which turns into very hot ionized gas or plasma. Surprisingly, part of this material is ejected away from the black hole forming narrow beams of plasma that move at near the speed of light. These beams, when directed at Earth, make some of the brightest and extreme sources ever observed in the Universe.  The proposing team plans to perform the largest numerical simulations to study how matter falls from the vast scale of the galaxy into the tiny scale of the black hole and follow how the narrow fast beams of plasma form and shine as they propagate through the galaxy. The results from the numerical simulations will be publicly accessible through a user-friendly, interactive website.

This exciting multi-messenger discovery motivates a detailed study of relativistic jet physics, to interpret this and upcoming multi-messenger observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The team proposes to perform multi-scale jet simulations that connect accretion physics, fluid dynamics, particle acceleration, and radiative transfer, to study the multi-wavelength polarized radiation signatures and neutrinos from AGN jets. The team plans to perform the largest to date general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of AGN accretion and jets, extending from the black hole to the blazar emission zone. They will use first-principle kinetic plasma simulations to calculate particle acceleration in jet dissipation zones and build comprehensive multi-messenger polarized radiative transfer that includes all the relevant physics. In this way, the team can bridge the gap between first-principle modeling and multi-messenger observations, and advance the understanding of AGN jet physics responsible for multi-messenger emission. The team will disseminate the results to the public through an immersive website, train high-school students, and organize a summer school in compact objects for graduate students, where participants will work on theoretical and/or numerical problems at the forefront of the research field.<br/><br/>This award addresses/advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big Idea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Radar echo detection is the process by which radio waves are re?ected from an object in order to measure its properties, including position, direction, and spatial extent.  High-energy particles interacting in a dense material like ice produce cascades of charged particles and a dense cloud of ionization, which re?ects incident radio waves, allowing for remote detection of high-energy particles such as neutrinos.  Such radar echoes have already been observed in a test-beam measurement.  This work will establish the technical aspects of this transformative  detector  technology for  neutrinos with energies of 10 peta-electron-volts (PeV)  and  beyond.  Expanding access to scienti?c thought and activities at a young age is a key step towards expanding general scienti?c literacy and training future scientists from all backgrounds.  The NSF-supported ASPIRE program at The Ohio State University for high school women will be extended to involve the radar detection of meteors.  Students will design, construct, and use an antenna to detect a faint radio signal, inspiring curiosity and creativity.<br/><br/>The first installation to be planned will be the Radar Echo Telescope (RET) for Cosmic Rays (RET-CR,) which will detect cascades from ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and develop the techniques for the future RET for neutrinos, RET-N.  UHECR are well studied and make an ideal, in-situ ?test beam?.  The optical Cherenkov detector IceCube has detected neutrinos above 1PeV, and its upgrade will extend this to ~10 PeV.  The RET targets neutrinos with energies in the 10-100 PeV range, for which there is no existing technology with greater sensitivity.  Detecting a statistically signi?cant population of 10-100 PeV neutrinos is crucial to probe the sources of UHECR and to measure neutrino-nucleon interactions at center-of-mass energies >100 TeV, both open experimental questions.

The foundation of this proposal is built upon a collaborative effort between the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery Virtual Environments Group, the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center (WIPAC), the Field Day Lab from the University of Wisconsin - Madison campus, and an Antarctic research scientist and educator, Jean Pennycook. The collaborative team will create a VR experience to tell the story of Adelie Penguins and how they impact the lives of all citizens. The project will enhance and improve the public?s understanding of the research on Adelie penguins that is currently underway in Antarctica and that is outlined in the book ?Becoming Joey? by Jean Pennycook with a narrative that includes an interdisciplinary scientific focus on fields such as atmospheric sciences, ecology and biology. The final VR product will be showcased in a public exhibition space, VR app stores, national and international science events, and publicly accessible websites. The experience will provide closed captioning and translations for Spanish and other relevant languages to enable a greater accessibility for the created products.  The project will also serve as a training tool and resource for two local educators through a fellowship program.<br/><br/>The project will allow users to virtually experience the science behind Adelie Penguins in an engaging  way through embodying the user as an Adelie Penguin to partake in a narrative-based VR application that shares the story of the lives of these unique animals. VR technology enables users to experience environments that are difficult or impossible to physically inhabit, such as the Earth?s polar regions. The embodied interaction will provide a wealth of information around a participant?s actions and perspectives. Previous work from the project team has shown that viewpoint analysis of a virtual experience can pinpoint salient features in a 3D environment that can be used to provide a summary of events. Recent work has shown that player actions inside of video games can be used to predict learning outcomes and early quitting, but little work has studied these effects in VR.

The observations of HAWC will probe the most extreme environments in the Universe, providing a unique view of non-thermal processes in the Galaxy and beyond. The key science goals of HAWC are to: (a) Measure the spectrum of Galactic sources to the highest energies; (b) Map the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission from 1 TeV to 100 TeV, measuring the cosmic-ray flux and spectrum across the Galaxy; (c) Study transient emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN); (d) Monitor the sky for 100 GeV emission from gamma-ray bursts; and (e) Search for new TeV physics with HAWC's unbiased sky survey. HAWC measurements have the potential to shed light on the fundamental symmetries of nature, including the search for Lorentz violation at extreme energies, the search for the dark matter in the universe, and the direct detection of massive relic particles. HAWC is a water Cherenkov air-shower detector consisting of 300 large water tanks. The tanks will be densely packed to cover an area of about 20,000 square meters. The goal is to begin taking data while the array is under construction and to have the full detector online within approximately three years. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: HAWC is an all-sky instrument that will serve as a TeV ""finder"" telescope for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and IceCube and will have the sensitivity to extend the measurement of satellite-discovered sources to TeV. HAWC will build on the strong outreach record of Milagro to bring this exciting field of research to students and the general public. Since HAWC is a joint US-Mexican project, this will be an excellent opportunity to attract talented Hispanic students to the field of Particle Astrophysics and to Physics in general.

Observation and analysis of just this single event took weeks, and consumed a significant fraction of the human and computational resources of the global gravitational and astronomical communities. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at South Pole has recently identified a very high-energy (>PeV) neutrino and the Fermi and MAGIC observatories have identified high-energy gamma rays coincident in time and location with that neutrino. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) primary survey will start in late 2022, needing extra capacity to ensure the daily massive datasets are processed and coordinated with gravitational, particle, and other astronomical and astrophysical observations, and all in near- real-time and with very low latency. MMA needs now to address the challenges of this increase in the amount and complexity of data that will soon be upon us, as we start around-the-clock monitoring of frequent multi-messenger events. As such, this workshop on Cyberinfrastructure (CI) for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics will provide a forum for experts in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and Cyberinfrastracture to develop concepts for new community-scale data cyberinfrastructure for timely handling, processing, analysis, and modeling of multi-messenger astrophysical data. The workshop will be held at the Physical Science Complex at the University of Maryland on May 23-24, 2018.<br/><br/>This project advances the objectives of three of 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments: ""Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" and ""Growing Convergent Research at NSF"". The 10 big ideas will push forward the frontiers of U.S. research, provide innovative approaches to solve some of the most pressing problems the world faces, as well as lead to discoveries not yet known.

MMA was galvanized when the collision of two neutron stars (labeled GW/GRB 170817A) was detected last year by multiple large science instruments including the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), its sister gravitational wave observatory VIRGO in Italy, NASA's Fermi gamma-ray telescope in space, and many other optical and radio telescopes world-wide. These multiple measurements of just one event improved our estimate of the speed of gravity to phenomenal precision, confirmed that neutron star mergers are the origin of the heavier atomic elements, and gave us a measurement of the radii of neutron stars to about one kilometer accuracy. Over the next decade, LIGO will identify dozens of such events per year. In parallel, the NSF-supported IceCube neutrino observatory at the U.S. South Pole Station and other neutrino and cosmic ray observatories are detecting high-energy cosmic rays from distant cosmological sources; and the new NSF-led Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and upcoming radio astronomy facilities will come online to survey the skies with unprecedented speed and depth throughout the Universe. While each kind of astronomical observing system will bring fascinating new discoveries, it is in their combination - through MMA - that transformative new insights into some of the most fundamental questions about the Universe can be realized: What is the nature of the highest-energy cosmic particle accelerators? What are the properties of cold and hot bulk matter at supra-nuclear densities? How do black holes form and evolve, across their full range of masses, and throughout cosmic time?<br/> <br/>The promise of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics can be realized only if sufficient cyberinfrastructure is available to rapidly handle, combine, and analyze the very large-scale distributed data from all the types of astronomical measurements. This project seeks to carry out community planning for scalable cyberinfrastructure to support MMA. The primary goal is to identify the key questions and cyberinfrastructure projects required by the community to take full advantage of the substantial investments in current facilities, and to realize the enormous potential of the multiple imminent next-generation projects over the decade to come. Two products of the project will be: 1) a community white paper that presents an in-depth analysis of the cyberinfrastructure needs and the opportunities for collaborations among astronomers, computer scientists, and data scientists; and 2) a strategic plan for a scalable cyberinfrastructure institute for multi-messenger astrophysics laying out its proposed mission, identifying the highest priority areas for cyberinfrastructure research and development for the US-based multi-messenger astrophysics community, and presenting a strategy for managing and evolving a set of services that benefits and engages the entire community.<br/> <br/>This project advances the objectives of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) and the objectives of ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" and ""Windows on the Universe, two of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.<br/> <br/>This project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical & Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A new type of live/dead stain for microbes will be used to see if the decrease is related to the death rate of microbes responsible for the slow decrease of intensity with depth. Previous work on GISP2 ice has shown that methane concentrations in deeper sections of the core were an order of magnitude higher than the variations due to climate change. The conclusion from the prior work suggested that the methane spikes were due to methanogens at those depths that were metabolizing while frozen in the ice. With the Berkeley Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (BFS) measurements will be made on WAIS Divide ice at the National Ice Core Laboratory (NICL) to look for unusually large spikes of Trp and Chl that will inform gas chemists of the exact depths to look for gas anomalies (i.e., concentration spikes that may not be related to climate). In fluorimetric scanning of GISP2 ice at NICL, increases in Trp were found at many depths, corresponding to depths with nitrous oxide (N2O) spikes.  Flow cytometry with excitation by a 405 nm laser will also be used to look for F420 autofluorescence emission at ~465 nm as a signature of methanogens. Previous measurements with the optical logger enabled many more volcanic ash layers to be found in the Dome C ice core than had been found with other methods. The recent discovery that logging of a freshly drilled borehole, to the bottom of WAIS Divide, resulted in a higher-resolution dust pattern and a far greater concentration of clearly resolvable volcanic ash layers than had been found in older boreholes is something that will be explored. Using these new ice core logging results, it will be possible to see if any ash layers coincide in time with volcanic ash layers that have been found at other sites and will strengthen existing evidence for a causal relationship between large volcanic eruptions and spikes in the dust log, indicative of abrupt climate changes.  The intellectual merit of the work is that the data will contribute to a better understanding of the processes that contribute to gaseous impurities in the ice and to developing a better understanding of the link between global volcanism and climate. Finally, 47 micro-inclinometers are installed in the ice at various depths and lateral positions in optical modules that are frozen into the IceCube array. They have been recording tilt for nearly a year. These data will be analyzed for an additional three years which will provide an unique opportunity to study the shear-strain rate of a huge volume of cold glacial ice as a function of shear stress. The broader impacts of the work include the possibility of applications to Mars exploration, studies of life in ancient ice, oceanography, limnology, meteorology, climate and volcanology. The project will contribute to the education and training of a broad range of undergraduate and graduate students and post-docs from the U. S. and other countries."

Studying these distant collisions enables us to probe the fundamental laws of physics, the evolution of the universe, and the origin of our Galaxy or even our Solar System. This research will address a fundamental aspect of cosmic collisions: their ability to accelerate particles to extremely high energies, about a billion times higher than what has been achieved on Earth. The work will search for the neutrino signature of extreme acceleration from collisions detected by gravitational waves. In particular it will elucidate the currently unknown mechanisms by which black holes can eject energetic particles while swallowing matter from the debris of the collision. Additionally, the observation of multiple cosmic messengers from colliding black holes and neutron stars will be developed and used as an education tool to train students in physics and beyond.<br/><br/>The major theme of the project is the multi-messenger observation of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos from compact binary mergers and core-collapse supernovae. Data will be analyzed from the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories and the IceCube neutrino observatory. The main goal of the work is to find and understand multi-messenger sources that are electromagnetically dark due to dense gas, stellar envelope, or ejecta between the source and the observer. The work will investigate a state-of-the-art search technique to help LIGO achieve its full potential by bringing closer the detection of the last missing puzzle piece from multi-messenger astrophysics: the joint observation of gravitational waves and neutrinos.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, searches will be conducted by cross-correlating the data acquired by the LIGO observatories during the latest LIGO science run (S5), and during the upcoming science run (S6) which will take advantage of the better sensitivity of LIGO detectors. These searches will establish the world's most sensitive measurements of the energy density of gravitational waves. Moreover, a study will be performed to assess the gravity gradient noise for Advanced LIGO: the gravity gradient noise is expected to limit the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO detectors at lowest frequencies, which are most sensitive to the SGWB.<br/><br/>The SGWB is expected to be produced in the earliest stages in the history of the Universe. Hence, direct observation of the SGWB would provide a glimpse of a very young Universe, much younger than what is possible using other astrophysical techniques. It would also represent a very rare probe of the particle physics of the highest energies, currently not accessible to accelerator-based particle physics experiments. The SGWB could also be produced by a large number of violent astrophysical events, such as gamma ray bursts or supernovae. Hence, direct observation of the SGWB would provide information about these exotic events as well. This project will allow undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars to be directly involved in this very exciting field of cosmology and astrophysics, and to make significant contributions to them. The project also includes building a web-accessible archive of models and experiments in the field of SGWB, hence providing a broader educational impact on the cosmology and astrophysics communities, as well as on non-scientific audience."

High-energy particles interacting in a dense material like ice produce cascades of charged particles and a dense cloud of ionization, which re?ects incident radio waves, allowing for remote detection of high-energy particles such as neutrinos.  Such radar echoes have already been observed in a test-beam measurement.  This work will establish the technical aspects of this transformative  detector  technology for  neutrinos with energies of 10 peta-electron-volts (PeV)  and  beyond.  Expanding access to scienti?c thought and activities at a young age is a key step towards expanding general scienti?c literacy and training future scientists from all backgrounds.  The NSF-supported ASPIRE program at The Ohio State University for high school women will be extended to involve the radar detection of meteors.  Students will design, construct, and use an antenna to detect a faint radio signal, inspiring curiosity and creativity.<br/><br/>The first installation to be planned will be the Radar Echo Telescope (RET) for Cosmic Rays (RET-CR,) which will detect cascades from ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) and develop the techniques for the future RET for neutrinos, RET-N.

While visually spectacular, less than 1% of the energy in the supernova is released as visible light or as kinetic energy in the surrounding environment.  Most of the energy from the supernova is released in neutrinos, which are small particles that only interact weakly with matter.  The neutrino emission from a supernova precedes the emission of visible light by a few minutes up to many hours.  Detecting the first neutrinos from a supernova therefore provides an early alert to trigger further observations.  The SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) is a network of neutrino detectors around the world designed to provide automated early alerts for supernovae in our galaxy.  While rare, a galactic supernova would provide a unique opportunity to study the physics of core-collapse supernova, as well as the properties of neutrinos.  The early alerts from SNEWS will enable observations of the earliest phases of the supernova for physicists and astronomers around the world.  The SNEWS project works to engage amateur astronomers, who may play an important role in optical observations of supernova, and to involve them in the science of supernova.  <br/><br/>SNEWS involves neutrino detectors around the world: Super-K, Large Volume Detector, IceCube, Borexino, KAMLand, and Daya Bay.  If any of the participating experiments finds a burst of events, it sends a datagram to the central SNEWS computer located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, with a backup located in Bologna.  If a coincidence is found within 10 seconds, a supernova alert will be sent out.  SNEWS has been operational since 1998, and has been running in a fully-automated mode since 2005 with near-100% up-time.

This award supports the gamma-ray group at Columbia University and Nevis Labs to focus specifically on: (1) operating and optimizing the prototype Schwarzschild-Couder Telescope (pSCT); (2) coordinating deployment of advanced analysis and simulations development work for the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope array VERITAS; (3) studying the physics of central engines, their environments, and relativistic jets; (4) understanding the acceleration and propagation of Galactic cosmic rays; and (5) seeking out further time-domain opportunities for VERITAS and in preparation for the next generation Cherenkov Telescope Array, CTA.  The mixture of fundamentally important questions and extreme physical environments makes this field fascinating to the public.  The Columbia and Barnard groups share that excitement via public lectures, and mentoring area high school students.  They also provide vital research experiences to their undergraduates.<br/><br/>These questions cut across high-energy astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics, studying the nature of dark matter, the sources of the highest-energy cosmic rays, the interactions of matter in the most extreme environments, and the cosmic history of star formation.  This project includes integrating pSCT into the VERITAS array, and extending the advanced shower reconstruction and background discrimination methods to low energy, short-time-scale exposures for GRBs and for large-zenith-angle observations of transients and the Galactic Center (GC).  VERITAS, being in southern Arizona, is ideally sited to follow up events from LIGO/Virgo and IceCube, and to study multi-TeV emission from the GC.  The planned analysis developments benefit all VERITAS science, but will be especially impactful for multi-messenger astronomy and the physics of the GC.  As the international community works towards CTA, currently undergoing critical optimization, demonstrating the pSCT's performance will maximize the impact of CTA on particle astrophysics in the years to come.  This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a minority of the galaxies their observed light is dominated by a single source: the supermassive black hole located at their very center. In these galaxies, the black hole feeds on material which turns into very hot ionized gas or plasma. Surprisingly, part of this material is ejected away from the black hole forming narrow beams of plasma that move at near the speed of light. These beams, when directed at Earth, make some of the brightest and extreme sources ever observed in the Universe.  The proposing team plans to perform the largest numerical simulations to study how matter falls from the vast scale of the galaxy into the tiny scale of the black hole and follow how the narrow fast beams of plasma form and shine as they propagate through the galaxy. The results from the numerical simulations will be publicly accessible through a user-friendly, interactive website. The user (scientist, teacher or high-school student) will be able to generate images of these beams in real-time and will thus be exposed to an exciting field of modern high-energy astrophysics.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2<br/><br/>Recent detection by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory of a very high energy neutrino event coincident with multi-wavelength flaring of blazar TXS 0506+056 strongly suggests that blazars do not only produce high-energy photons but also ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. This exciting multi-messenger discovery motivates a detailed study of relativistic jet physics, to interpret this and upcoming multi-messenger observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The team proposes to perform multi-scale jet simulations that connect accretion physics, fluid dynamics, particle acceleration, and radiative transfer, to study the multi-wavelength polarized radiation signatures and neutrinos from AGN jets. The team plans to perform the largest to date general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of AGN accretion and jets, extending from the black hole to the blazar emission zone. They will use first-principle kinetic plasma simulations to calculate particle acceleration in jet dissipation zones and build comprehensive multi-messenger polarized radiative transfer that includes all the relevant physics. In this way, the team can bridge the gap between first-principle modeling and multi-messenger observations, and advance the understanding of AGN jet physics responsible for multi-messenger emission. The team will disseminate the results to the public through an immersive website, train high-school students, and organize a summer school in compact objects for graduate students, where participants will work on theoretical and/or numerical problems at the forefront of the research field.<br/><br/>This award addresses/advances the goals of the Windows on the Universe Big Idea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The search for dark matter addresses one of the fundamental questions in particle astrophysics. Current models predict that our galaxy is encased in a halo of dark matter. As the Sun orbits around the Milky Way Galaxy and the Earth around the Sun, we expect there to be an annual modulation in the flux of dark matter that passes through the Earth. Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions (which have been introduced to explain the smallness of the violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry in Quantum ChromoDynamics, the theory describing the action of the strong force) have been proposed as theoretically favored candidates for dark matter. Despite the strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, neither WIMPs nor axions have been conclusively detected. One experiment, DAMA/LIBRA, claims to have directly detected the expected annual modulation signal. Despite concerted efforts, no other experiment has detected WIMPs. COSINE-100 was designed, built, and started taking data in 2016 to test DAMA/LIBRA's claim of detection of dark matter and provide a definitive resolution to the longest-standing controversy in the dark matter field. <br/><br/>An essential component will be to engage and educate students and postdocs in the proposed research. As a woman co-spokesperson of an international experimental collaboration, the PI has a unique opportunity to serve as a role model to the next generation of scientists. The program builds on the PI's record of continued commitment to public outreach and education. The PI strives to maintain an inclusive environment in her group and is committed to recruiting and training future scientists from all racial and socioeconomic backgrounds, especially those from under-represented groups. The PI and members of her group will communicate the excitement of this science to the surrounding communities through outreach activities, leveraging outreach programs such as the Day of Instrumentation, Girls Science Investigations, and the Yale Pathway to Science, organized by the Yale University.<br/><br/>The sodium iodide detector technology was developed under the previous NSF grant, and follows the successful deployment and operation of DM-Ice17 together with IceCube at the South Pole. COSINE-100 uses the same target medium and detector technology as DAMA/LIBRA. The experiment consists of 106 kg of thallium-doped sodium-iodide crystals deployed at the Yangyang Underground Laboratory, operated by COSINE-100 collaborators at the Center for Underground Physics of the Institute for Basic Science in South Korea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before the core is even processed, data from the borehole probe will immediately determine the depth-age relationship, augment 3D mapping of South Pole stratigraphy, aid in searches for the oldest ice in Antarctica, and reveal layers of volcanic or extraterrestrial fallout.  Regarding the intellectual merit, the oriented borehole log will be essential for investigating features in the ice sheet that may have implications for ice core chronology, ice flow, ice sheet physical properties and stability in response to climate change.  The tools and techniques developed in this program have applications in glaciology, biogeoscience and exploration of other planetary bodies. The program aims for a deeper understanding of the consequences and causes of abrupt climate change. The broader impacts of the project are that it will include outreach and education, providing a broad training ground for students and post-docs.  Data and metadata will be made available through data centers and repositories such as the National Snow and Ice Data Center web portal. <br/><br/>The laser dust logger detects reproducible paleoclimate features at sub-centimeter depth scale.  Dust logger data are being used for synchronizing records and dating any site on the continent, revealing accumulation anomalies and episodes of rapid ice sheet thinning, and discovering particulate horizons of special interest.  In this project we will deploy a laser dust logger equipped with a magnetic compass to find direct evidence of preferentially oriented dust.  Using optical scattering measurements from IceCube calibration studies at South Pole and borehole logs at WAIS Divide, we have detected a persistent anisotropy correlated with flow and crystal fabric which suggests that the majority of insoluble particulates must be located within ice grains.  With typical concentrations of parts-per-billion, little is known about the location of impurities within the polycrystalline structure of polar ice.  While soluble impurities are generally thought to concentrate at inter-grain boundaries and determine electrical conductivity, the fate of insoluble particulates is much less clear, and microscopic examinations are extremely challenging.  These in situ borehole measurements will help to unravel intimate relationships between impurities, flow, and crystal fabric.  Data from this project will further develop a unique record of South Pole surface roughness as a proxy for paleowind and provide new insights for understanding glacial radar propagation.  This project has field work in Antarctica."

The HAWC collaboration consists of 14 US and 11 Mexican institutions. The observations of HAWC will probe the most extreme environments in the Universe, providing a unique view of non-thermal processes in the Galaxy and beyond. The key science goals of HAWC are to: (a) Measure the spectrum of Galactic sources to the highest energies; (b) Map the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission from 1 TeV to 100 TeV, measuring the cosmic-ray flux and spectrum across the Galaxy; (c) Study transient emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN); (d) Monitor the sky for 100 GeV emission from gamma-ray bursts; and (e) Search for new TeV physics with HAWC's unbiased sky survey. HAWC measurements have the potential to shed light on the fundamental symmetries of nature, including the search for Lorentz violation at extreme energies, the search for the dark matter in the universe, and the direct detection of massive relic particles. HAWC is a water Cherenkov air-shower detector consisting of 300 large water tanks. The tanks will be densely packed to cover an area of about 20,000 square meters. The goal is to begin taking data while the array is under construction and to have the full detector online within approximately three years. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: HAWC is an all-sky instrument that will serve as a TeV ""finder"" telescope for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and IceCube and will have the sensitivity to extend the measurement of satellite-discovered sources to TeV. HAWC will build on the strong outreach record of Milagro to bring this exciting field of research to students and the general public. Since HAWC is a joint US-Mexican project, this will be an excellent opportunity to attract talented Hispanic students to the field of Particle Astrophysics and to Physics in general. The project has developed an outreach video about HAWC and web materials about HAWC and Particle Astrophysics in both Spanish and English."

Already, experiments like Fermi GST and PAMELA are producing very exciting - though puzzling - results that may be major hints to an unexpectedly rich dark matter sector. There are many possibilities for dramatic discoveries, which will usher in a new era for dark matter and fundamental particle physics. How one combines the complementary information from these disparate measurements into a cohesive picture is not readily apparent. Initially, it is unlikely that an obvious picture will emerge that is more compelling than conventional explanations, such as poorly understood modeling or experimental systematics. Thus, one must be prepared to pose serious questions about the data, the theoretical interpretation, the experimental systematics, and additional modeling assumptions that are not limited by avoidable technical limitations. This award supports a program of physics research built around a unifying approach to large-scale scientific data analysis, initially dealing with data from LHC experiments, in a way that is scalable with respect to complexity of data, experimental apparatuses, and theoretical models. The approach could have profound impact on early standard model physics measurements and the extension to Higgs physics and beyond as well as facilitate communication and cooperation between ATLAS and CMS, between theorists and experimentalists, and among researchers from different disciplines. <br/>In terms of broader impact the key development in this award that enables the scalable approach to large-scale data analysis is applicable beyond the field of particle physics. Experiments as diverse as Fermi GST, HESS, and the IceCube neutrino telescope are already exploring the use of this technology, which is a concrete indication of the broader impacts of the proposed research. Additional impacts follow from a well-integrated educational and outreach component. A portable and professionally-designed exhibit will be constructed for use at the popular New York City World Science Festival street fair, area science fairs, career fairs, and the like. The booth will utilize existing material from the ATLAS outreach group. Additionally, the exhibit will be the basis for a project integrated into a teaching methods course in the Department of Teaching and Learning at NYU. The project will be to design activities for the exhibit itself and to develop and assess physics teaching methods. Thus, the exhibit, the activities, and the assessment of the exhibit will be the culmination of a semester-long project, and those teachers can bring the developed activities to their own schools. Finally, the PI will mentor high-school students from the Harlem Children's Society so that they can understand and operate the demonstrations, thus serving as peer-group liaisons, and role models for under-represented groups in the sciences."

TAUWER will implement it so as to provide an instrument of greater sensitivity, straight-forward expansion by an order of magnitude, and relatively low cost. TAUWER is a two-layer scintillator sampling telescope to detect the upward-moving air showers from tau hadronic decays. The hadronic decay channel of the tau-lepton makes possible a simple detection scheme based on identifying gammas, electrons and muons and determining their spatial density around the shower axis. Thus, detecting the showers from a set of tau-lepton decays gives a good estimate of the parent tau-neutrino spectrum. TAUWER is expandable, should future data indicate that need.<br/><br/>Previous work by this group has demonstrated that TAUWER detectors can separate upward and downward moving tracks by time of flight and to separate electrons and muons by waveform analysis after a Pb converter. This award provides funding to address the next crucial question in TAUWER validation - how well can one reject Extensive Air Shower (EAS) events in which independent particles hit the two scintillator tiles of a detector station and produce a signal that mimics the timing associated with an upward-moving shower particle? The three groups will work on building a library of tau-neutrino interactions and air shower development to use in building the multivariate likelihood scheme needed to go from shower profile and composition information back to parent neutrino energy and angle. Finally, there will be efforts to develop more cost-effective methods to handle the readout and waveform digitization. All these steps are crucial to the ultimate goal of constructing TAUWER as a premiere Neutrino Astronomy (NA) telescope to complement and extend the work now underway at IceCube and Auger.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic neutrinos potentially open the way to understanding the acceleration mechanisms in Active Galactic Nuclei and other black-hole related sources distributed throughout the space-time continuum of our universe. The successful implementation and operation of TAUWER will have broad impact on black hole cosmology and on the fundamental question of the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays, one of the fundamental questions of our time."

Logging at 20-50 cm/sec, in a matter of hours, mm-scale depth resolution of dust concentration and volcanic ash layers over the entire 3270 m borehole back to ~800 ka can be provided. The logger probes an area of order m2 of the horizon compared to the ~0.02 m2 core, greatly suppressing depositional noise and making the technique immune to core damage or loss. The method achieves unprecedented resolution of climate variations for matching or comparing ice core records, can detect particulate layers from explosive fallout which are invisible or missing in the core, and often reveals subtle trend changes which can elude standard core analyses.  With the highly resolved dust record, it is expected to find new synchronous age markers between East Antarctica, West Antarctica and Greenland. The data could be instrumental in unifying global climate records, or resolving mysteries such as the transition from 41-kyr glacial cycles to apparent 100-kyr cycles.  The project will extend previous finding, which make the most convincing case to date for a causal relationship between explosive volcanic events and abrupt climate change on millennial timescales. A search will also be made for evidence that some of the worldwide explosive fallout events that have been identified may have resulted from impacts by comets or asteroids. The investigators will evaluate the reliability of terrestrial impact crater records and the possibility that Earth impacts are considerably more frequent than is generally appreciated. Better understanding of the factors which force abrupt climate changes, the recurrence rate and triggering mechanisms of large volcanic eruptions, and the frequency of Gt to Tt-energy bolide impacts are of vital interest for civilization.  The work plan for 2008-11 comprises modifying and testing of existing hardware in year one; logging field work, most likely in year two; data analysis and publication of results in year three. Because the EPICA collaborators will provide a suitable logging winch onsite, the logistical needs of this project are modest and can be accommodated by Twin Otter from McMurdo.  The proposal is in the spirit of the International Polar Year (IPY) by forging an international collaboration with potential societal benefit. The project will provide interdisciplinary training to students and postdoctoral fellows from the U.S. and other countries. <br/><br/>"

Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) have similarly caught the attention of physicists and astrophysicists, leading to, among other ideas, postulates of exotic origin based on predictions from particle physics. To make clearer a possible connection between UHECRs and GRBs, one needs to  refine  our understanding of how the cosmic ray spectrum couples to burst gamma-ray emission. Forging a more robust model of this connection is a principal goal of this proposal. The mandate to do so has been enhanced by the recent confirmation of the existence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff in the UHECR spectrum at around 6 ? 1019 eV by the Pierre Auger experiment. This project will address how does the relativistic nature of the shocked outflow in bursts influence the prompt emission spectra that was detected in the gamma-ray band. A second question that will be addressed is what is the relative efficiency of accelerating electrons and ions in relativistic shocks thought to be present in GRBs, and how can photon data from these sources be used to probe this efficiency ratio,. Two other questions that will be investigated are whether GRB shocks efficiently generate ion populations up to the extremely high UHECR energies, and what are the anticipated neutrino fluxes from GRBs as potential signals for the IceCube experiment?  The broader impacts are that  the results will be adapted for display on publicly maintained Web sites. A graduate student will be engaged as an integral part of the work and this student will be involved in teaching at least two lectures per year on gamma-ray bursts in appropriate ndergraduate Rice courses.

The next phase is to continue observations with these testbed stations to accumulate knowledge about RF properties of the upper layers of the ice sheet at South Pole and develop reliable hardware and software for deployable in-ice stations in the future. Recently-deployed three testbed stations are currently operational collecting data. Although the deployment of three testbed stations was generally successful, a number of problems were found in the full, 37-stations array deployment plans. This award is to provide bridge funds to keep the deployed testbed stations operational for another 12 months, while the project team reworks their proposal devising a staged approach for the full array deployment."

This award will provide funds to purchase a system comprised of four highly effective, purpose-built deep learning nodes to be used for a wide array of deep learning applications. An additional purchase of two state-of-the-art, purpose-built deep learning nodes for high-dimensional, memory-hungry and/or data-rich applications is also enabled. The four ?staging? nodes will permit development and testing prior to deployment on the two state-of-the-art nodes. The full six-node system will be used by members of the Deep Learning for Statistics, Astrophysics, Geoscience, Engineering, Meteorology and Atmospheric Science, Physical Sciences and Psychology (DL-SAGEMAPP) team and the broader community at the Pennsylvania State University. The team will provide access to the hardware to roughly 300 advanced undergraduate and graduate students each year, for use in courses in multiple departments that either focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence or include those topics in their curricula. The team will also host an annual multi-day hands-on workshop in deep learning. The workshop will welcome all students in the DL-SAGEMAPP team?s research areas but will advertise most heavily to students from underrepresented groups. Team members will also contribute deep learning sessions to one or more of the annual workshops for K-12 teachers held by Penn State?s Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, with the potential to convey deep learning ideas to grade-school students.<br/><br/>The goal is to create a cutting-edge, shared resource that supports a diverse set of researchers, allowing them to transform problems that are currently impractical or impossible to solve with existing computational resources into proverbial ?low-hanging fruit.? The DL-SAGEMAPP team will harness the power of deep learning to tackle some of the most challenging problems in their respective areas of research. With purpose-built hardware and popular open software, the team will apply deep learning methodologies to problems with high dimensionality, high data volume, and/or requiring very complex network topologies; problems that would take too long to run or would be too large to fit in on-board memory for most standard hardware configurations. This team aims to boost the search for multimessenger astrophysical signals by improving the sensitivity and response time of flagship high-energy neutrino, gravitational wave, and wide-field survey observatories. The team will apply deep learning to the simulation and analysis of satellite and aerial data, leading to greater predictive power for impending volcanic activity and the build-up of sea ice in the Arctic, and greater acuity with cloud-shrouded ground targets. Deep learning techniques will be used to increase the accuracy of flood forecasting, improve the accuracy and turnaround time of molecular-level simulations, delve more deeply into the process of protein synthesis by mRNA, tackle the analysis of increasingly large data volumes from brain-implanted electrodes, and sharpen researchers? understanding of the human visual system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Observations of these cosmogenic neutrinos probe the structure and evolution of the Universe and test physics at energies beyond the standard models.

One of the most outstanding questions in astronomy and astrophysics addresses the origin and evolution of the cosmic accelerators that produce the highest energy (UHE) cosmic rays. This question may be best addressed through the observation of UHE cosmogenic neutrinos that travel from their source undeflected by galactic and interstellar magnetic fields and unimpeded by interactions with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. However, uncertainties in the predicted cosmogenic neutrino fluxes make it difficult to design an array with sufficient sensitivity to collect a statistically meaningful sample of events. At very high energies (above 10^15 eV), neutrinos could be most efficiently detected in dense, radio frequency (RF) transparent media via the Askaryan effect. The abundant cold ice covering the Antarctic, with its exceptional RF clarity, has been hosting several pioneering efforts to develop this RF approach. From the expertise gained in these experiments and utilizing the infrastructure developed by the U.S. Antarctic Program, it is proposed to develop radio-listening equipment that can constitute the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) and install it in the ice near the geographical South Pole. The primary goal of the ARA array will be establishing the absolute cosmogenic neutrino flux through the modest number of events. As the proposed radio antennae are deployed in ice holes extending below the firn layer to 200-m depth, they will have the ability to distinguish surface noise from sources originating deep in the ice cap (otherwise not possible in balloon-borne experiments). The ARA will have sufficient sensitivity to establish the presence or absence of the secondary UHE neutrinos produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with CMB. Such an observatory would also provide a unique probe of long-baseline high-energy neutrino interactions unattainable with any manmade neutrino beam. The adopted clustered geometry of the array (in which a single localized cluster may act as a standalone array) would allow trading the precise angular resolution for the increased event rates. The flux measurement and experience gained in operating the limited number of stations would frame the performance requirements needed to expand the array in the future to measure a larger number of neutrinos with greater angular precision in order to study their spectrum and origins. The project will continue contributing significantly to the training of the next generation of scientists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with the technology and instrumentation development."
