The research will include monitoring Advanced LIGO's data quality and developing hardware for upgrading the detectors. Specifically supported are i) The design and development of adaptive mode-matching for Advanced LIGO's output mode cleaner, enabling the use of non-classical squeezed-vacuum in the detector to improve the observational range. ii) A search for rare detector artifacts and low-level environmental correlations, prone to diminish the scientific return from Advanced LIGO.<br/> <br/>Einstein's general theory of relativity predicts that violent cosmic events, such as for example colliding neutron stars, lead to tiny distortions of space-time here on earth, measurable as minuscule fluctuations in the distance between suspended optical mirrors. The NSF-funded Advanced LIGO project intends to precisely measure these so-called gravitational waves. Advanced LIGO's sensitivity is limited by the quantization of light, but can be improved by using an additional non-classical light source. Such light sources are however extremely sensitive to optical losses. This award supports the development of adaptive elements in the beam path to guarantee that all the light coming from the interferometer can be detected. Additionally, environmental disturbances have the potential to mimic the tiny distance fluctuations due to gravitational waves. This award supports monitoring Advanced LIGO's data for such disturbances.  The first direct observation of gravitational waves will be a scientific break-through echoed in the news media, providing an outreach opportunity. The award supports workshops for high school teachers to bring the excitement of new scientific discoveries in this brand-new field of astronomy to high school class rooms."

This grant supports the work of members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration at Kenyon College.  Kenyon LIGO group members have lead roles in the calibration of the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) interferometers and the search for gravitational wave signals from large black holes.  The calibration of the aLIGO detectors is the first fundamental step after data has been collected by the detector.  Only after the data is calibrated can searches for gravitational wave signals begin.  LIGO scientists search for a range of sources, but the most promising source is the coalescence of two compact, astrophysical objects, such as black holes and neutron stars.  Historically, LIGO has performed careful searches for black hole systems with masses that range up to 100 times the mass of the Sun.  Members of the Kenyon LIGO group are part of the effort to expand this search to black holes of even higher masses.  These large black holes may hold key answers as to how the supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies were formed.   Additionally, the Kenyon LIGO group is exploring and improving aLIGO's ability to extract information about the matter that composes neutron stars in preparation for the first gravitational wave detection from a coalescing neutron star system.  While electromagnetic signals from binary neutron star systems can provide insight into the surface of neutron stars, the detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star system could dig deeper and reveal secrets of the illusive neutron star matter itself.  Finally, this project also supports the expansion of an existing NSF-funded outreach program at Kenyon College that targets engaging middle-school-aged audiences with exciting, hands-on science workshops.  Separate workshops are held for middle school boys (LADS: Learning and Doing Science) and middle school girls (GSS: Girls Science Saturdays) several Saturdays throughout the school year. <br/><br/>This award supports three main efforts in the field of gravitational-wave physics.  The first is related to ongoing work in the calibration of the aLIGO detectors.  Specifically, Kenyon LIGO group members will not only maintain existing low-latency calibration software, which is a large task as the calibration procedure is constantly changing with upgrades to the interferometers, but they will also work towards reducing the latency of the current calibration software from around a few tens of seconds down to a few seconds.  The lowest possible latency calibration is crucial for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave signal candidates.  The main methods that will be employed to reduce the latency of the calibration software are to reduce the complexity of the procedure, shift as much of the calibration procedure as possible into the real-time instrument computers, and improve the computational efficiency of all existing calibration software.  The award also supports the development and execution of a modeled, matched-filter search for intermediate mass black hole binary (IMBHB) systems.  The goal of the search is to make the first confident detection of black holes in the intermediate mass range or to provide upper limits on the existence of IMBHB systems.  Existing search software is being optimized to fit the needs of a higher mass, and therefore shorter waveform, matched filter search, and the search is being developed to run in a low-latency mode during future observing runs.  Finally, this grant supports the development of tools to extract information about the neutron star equation of state from a binary neutron star gravitational wave detection.  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) gravitational wave parameter estimation software is being modified to more optimally explore the neutron star equation of state parameter space, and software to allow for the use of different models of the neutron star equation of state is being developed. The first few gravitational wave detections from binary neutron star systems will be able to provide a wealth of new knowledge about neutron star matter."

These revolutionary achievements were enabled by sub-attometer position measurement technologies made possible over multi-kilometer baselines through the Advanced LIGO detector.  This new initiative, the  ""A+ upgrade"", can offer five times the gravitational wave event detection rate over the existing Advanced LIGO design. The enhanced capabilities afforded by A+ will be able to, among other science goals, illuminate the origins and evolution of stellar-mass black holes, allow precision tests of extreme gravity, enable detailed study of the equation of state of neutron stars, and permit new tests of cosmology, including fully independent constraints on the Hubble constant.  The A+ upgrade will also foster expanding community participation and enhance opportunities for education and public understanding of science. Both aspects of LIGO technology targeted by A+ are expected to be of keen interest to diverse communities, including quantum optics, quantum information theory, materials science, optical technology, precision metrology and physical standards.<br/><br/>The A+ upgrade addresses two technical limitations that have constrained the Advanced LIGO design target sensitivity: quantum mechanical uncertainty and classical Brownian noise in mirror coatings. The improved A+ instruments should reach observational readiness as soon as mid-2024, enabling LIGO to continue its leadership of the worldwide effort to open and exploit this new mode of observation. The A+ plan builds on the expertise and synergy of the joint international team that successfully delivered Advanced LIGO.  Approximately 35% of A+ hardware will be contributed by UK and Australian LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) groups, along with significant commitments of effort by UK and Australian personnel.

This noise reduces the number of observable gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources. It arises from thermal excitation of the vibrational modes of the mirrors in the LIGO detector optics. The effect of these excitations is reduced as the mechanical quality factor (Q) of the mirrors is increased. Since the Q of the mirrors is limited by the reflective coatings deposited on their surfaces, lower noise requires development of better coatings. The CCR combines groups from 10 institutions in the US working on computational modeling of amorphous materials, deposition of coatings, and characterization of their atomic structure and macroscopic properties. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these three communities focused on a unified research goal. Coating thermal noise is also a limiting factor in the fields of precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and precision measurements like the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. Coatings improving on the state of the art in mechanical and optical properties developed under this program would be applicable to these communities as well. On broader impacts in education, the mixture of undergraduate institutions with elite graduate programs provides research opportunities at all education levels and establishes clear avenues of advancement for students who wish to pursue a career within the physical sciences. In addition, the CCR has a strong commitment to the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities; and will also continue its participants' activities in issues of education and public outreach through all major channels of public and social media.<br/><br/>The A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will reduce quantum noise with squeezed light injection, leaving thermal noise dominant in the mid-band of the detector.  Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with A+ LIGO's mechanical and optical requirements. Meeting this goal requires solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: the nature and control of the low-energy excitations in amorphous oxides. On a longer time scale, developing mirror coatings for the cryogenic LIGO Voyager detector broadens the possibilities to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The primary research focus is to find conditions under which amorphous metal-oxide coatings can be deposited as ""ultrastable glasses"", which have a low density of the structural motifs that form two-level systems, the source of elastic dissipation. A second research track seeks methods to stabilize coatings against crystallization during high temperature annealing, another method known to reduce room temperature elastic losses. For the longer term research towards LIGO Voyager applications, the group will investigate non-oxide coatings such as single-crystal semiconductors AlGaAs and AlGaP, which have shown low mechanical loss for small geometries but whose scale up to the size of LIGO optics is challenging; and also amorphous silicon and silicon nitride, which have attractive mechanical properties but whose optical properties must be improved."

Future observations by LIGO and its international partners will discover many more merging black hole pairs. These observations will help us understand how these systems formed and will let us test general relativity in the ultra-strong gravity region produced by these coalescing black holes. The work funded here is primarily concerned with: (i) improving our ability to model the signals LIGO will detect from black hole mergers; (ii) developing techniques to model and detect a component of gravitational-wave signals that can shed light on the nonlinear nature of gravity, the matter and energy ejected by supernovae, or the dynamics of compact stars that experience close flybys; and (iii) exploring science objectives that could be achieved by the next generation of gravitational-wave experiments. The educational components of this work include: (i) training undergraduate and master's degree students at a regional public university serving a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds; (ii) developing and making available instructional materials and hands-on kits that teach LIGO science; (iii) engaging the broader public through lectures, outreach exhibits, and the continued development of the ""Sounds of Spacetime"" website (which explains gravitational-wave science via an analogy with sound waves).<br/><br/> The science objectives of this work are focused on (i) improving models of merging binary systems with elliptical (eccentric) orbits and (ii) the gravitational-wave memory effect.  Elliptical binaries: LIGO currently has many signal models to analyze circular-orbit binaries, but few for elliptical binaries. The group will develop new signal models to handle eccentric orbits and investigate the implications for parameter estimation and testing general relativity. If present in LIGO signals, eccentricity will have implications for compact object binary formation models and constraining possible deviations from general relativity (which could be biased if eccentricity is neglected). Memory effect: The memory effect refers to a non-oscillatory component of the gravitational-wave signal. It is produced by gravitational two-body scattering, ejected matter or neutrinos in supernovae, and nonlinear interactions during black hole mergers. The effort will improve existing models of the memory effect. It will also develop, test, and execute a search for memory bursts using LIGO data. This will broaden the class of signals that LIGO investigates and could provide a new way to test general relativity."

Gravitational wave detectors are interferometers in which an intense laser beam bounces between two sets of mirrors in orthogonal arms.  Gravitational waves cause differences in the path length of the laser beam between the two interferometer arms, giving rise to a distinct interference pattern that when analyzed identifies the event that created them. The detection sensitivity of GWD is determined by various noise sources, among which, thermal noise of the coatings in the mirrors of the interferometer is a main component. Thermal noise in the high reflectance amorphous oxide coatings in the interferometer's mirrors causes path length differences that can mask the signals from gravitational waves. To increase the sensitivity of present GWD and meet the demands of future GWD, a concerted effort to understand and control the mechanisms that give rise to thermal noise in amorphous oxide coatings is imperative. This work will form part of that effort. <br/><br/>This award supports research aimed at demonstrating  amorphous oxide coatings with significantly reduced thermal noise and superior optical properties that will enable an approximate 10x increase in sensitivity of state-of-the-art GWD. The research effort has two specific aims: 1) to  realize  amorphous metal oxide thin films by ion beam sputtering with reduced thermal noise through a systematic parametric study of the deposition conditions used to grow single films; and 2) to engineer  multilayer dielectric coatings using these materials with reduced mechanical loss compared to state-of-the-art. A synergistic characterization effort will support the materials' growth. In particular the CSU researchers will collaborate with Caltech researchers to assess mechanical loss in single and multilayer dielectric coatings. This research will support the LIGO program in different ways. Through fundamental studies in amorphous oxides it will enable investigations of the physical mechanisms that  come into play in affecting thermal noise. It will also offer the opportunity to seek for new coating designs that will increase sensitivity of advanced LIGO and of the next generation GWD. Synergistic collaborations with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) Coatings Group are planned to congruently advance the fundamental material science and coatings engineering efforts."

Increasing the sensitivity of the LIGO detector several times would increase the number of gravitational waves and the types of events observed. Future detectors, such as the A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will be limited by thermal noise associated with the mirror coatings used in the detector optics. The proposed work is a collaborative effort between Martin Fejer's group at Stanford University and Hai-Ping Cheng's group at the University of Florida to develop mirror coatings with lower thermal noise to address this problem for A+ LIGO and beyond. The Stanford gravitational wave research program has been involved for more than two decades in research to enable gravitational wave detectors by working closely with the LIGO Science Collaboration (LSC) to do critical research and mitigate difficult challenges. In the past, Stanford has contributed broadly to the development of novel interferometer components and design, detailed studies of the optics and mitigating optical and thermal noise, and the advanced seismic isolation systems used in Advanced LIGO (aLIGO). Hai-Ping Cheng's group at Florida is involved in computational materials simulations. In support of LIGO, she has modeled atomic structure of amorphous films and evaluated mechanical losses associated with those structures as part of a broader LSC effort to develop low-thermal-noise mirror coatings. <br/><br/>While Advanced LIGO has now operated with adequate sensitivity to detect black hole coalescences, its mid-band sensitivity will be limited by thermal noise resulting from mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings. Stanford has had a leading role within the LSC in developing experimental methods to characterize the optical, elastic, and structural properties of the amorphous materials composing multilayer dielectric mirrors. Florida carries out the current computational materials modeling effort within LSC. The proposed program is a synergistic teaming to combine these skill sets to address a critical issue to meet the design goals of A+ LIGO, developing mirrors with 2-4 times less mechanical loss than the best currently available. The mechanical losses in amorphous materials depend on subtle, preparation-dependent features in their atomic structure. Data on these structural features obtained via the electron diffraction and X-ray scattering methods proposed here is challenging to interpret, as are molecular dynamics predictions of the structure. Methods exist to use the modeling to help interpret the data and the data to help constrain the modeling, which led to the teaming arrangement proposed here. The structural data and predictions for dependence of elastic losses on material composition and process conditions, will become a major contributor to the broader LSC program to develop mirrors for A+ LIGO, guiding the others working on this problem through the thicket of possible synthesis and characterization experiments. Another long-standing effort at Stanford has been in the optical characterization of low-optical loss materials at the sub-ppm/cm level, dating back to the selection between silica and sapphire for initial LIGO test masses. The group has recently begun using the interferometric tool developed for those studies to characterize cryogenic losses in single-crystal silicon samples to evaluate their suitability as test masses in the planned cryogenic LIGO Voyager."

The rate and accuracy of these detections will improve as LIGO is upgraded. By comparing the detected waves with detailed predictions of the waves, scientists can measure properties (locations, masses, spins) of the black holes and learn about how they might have formed and how they warp space and time as they collide.  The predictions are made using the equations of General Relativity, written down by Einstein in 1915 but unsolvable (for colliding black holes) until about 2005 with the development of advanced methods and powerful supercomputers. This project supports theoretical work designed to underpin and improve LIGO's ability to extract from observed GWs the rich information that the waves carry.  This includes the improvement and use of the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), currently the most accurate computer code for solving Einstein's equations for black hole binaries. SpEC will be used to carry out numerical solutions of black-hole collisions for the purpose of analyzing LIGO data.  In addition, a new computer code SpECTRE will be developed; this is a next-generation upgrade of SpEC designed for new upcoming computer architectures and accuracies beyond those of current codes. SpECTRE will be used to predict gravitational waveforms from two colliding neutron stars and from a black hole colliding with a neutron star.  Gravitational waves from neutron-star collisions are expected to be observed by LIGO, and can teach scientists about how matter behaves at ultra-high densities.  This program will also serve as a training ground for young physicists and astrophysicists. The new code SpECTRE and its output will be publicly released.  Group members will reach out to the general public through lectures, interactive web pages, and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>By combining analytical techniques and numerical simulations with SpEC: (i) Gravitational-wave signals for black-hole binaries will be generated for use in LIGO data analysis, will be used to calibrate analytic models, and will be used to produce numerical surrogate models that can evaluate a single waveform in milliseconds while retaining the accuracy of full numerical simulations; and (ii) the dynamical behavior of highly curved spacetime will be explored via analytic, perturbative, and numerical approaches. The next-generation open-source code SpECTRE will be developed for numerical relativity simulations with matter and radiation. SpECTRE uses Discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. It is designed for high accuracy and high scalability on current and future supercomputers by following a novel task-based parallelization paradigm. SpECTRE's initial version already implements general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. It will be upgraded to handle the dynamical space  times of neutron star-neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, including nuclear-theory based hot equations of state and neutrinos. SpECTRE will be applied to studies of BH and accretion disk formation to understand dynamics and GW emission. It will be used for high-accuracy ultra-long neutron star inspiral simulations to predict GW signals and help LIGO constrain the nuclear equation of state."

This noise reduces the number of observable gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources. It arises from thermal excitation of the vibrational modes of the mirrors in the LIGO detector optics. The effect of these excitations is reduced as the mechanical quality factor (Q) of the mirrors is increased. Since the Q of the mirrors is limited by the reflective coatings deposited on their surfaces, lower noise requires development of better coatings. The CCR combines groups from 10 institutions in the US working on computational modeling of amorphous materials, deposition of coatings, and characterization of their atomic structure and macroscopic properties. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these three communities focused on a unified research goal. Coating thermal noise is also a limiting factor in the fields of precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and precision measurements like the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. Coatings improving on the state of the art in mechanical and optical properties developed under this program would be applicable to these communities as well. On broader impacts in education, the mixture of undergraduate institutions with elite graduate programs provides research opportunities at all education levels and establishes clear avenues of advancement for students who wish to pursue a career within the physical sciences. In addition, the CCR has a strong commitment to the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities; and will also continue its participants' activities in issues of education and public outreach through all major channels of public and social media.<br/><br/>The A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will reduce quantum noise with squeezed light injection, leaving thermal noise dominant in the mid-band of the detector.  Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with A+ LIGO's mechanical and optical requirements. Meeting this goal requires solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: the nature and control of the low-energy excitations in amorphous oxides. On a longer time scale, developing mirror coatings for the cryogenic LIGO Voyager detector broadens the possibilities to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The primary research focus is to find conditions under which amorphous metal-oxide coatings can be deposited as ""ultrastable glasses"", which have a low density of the structural motifs that form two-level systems, the source of elastic dissipation. A second research track seeks methods to stabilize coatings against crystallization during high temperature annealing, another method known to reduce room temperature elastic losses. For the longer term research towards LIGO Voyager applications, the group will investigate non-oxide coatings such as single-crystal semiconductors AlGaAs and AlGaP, which have shown low mechanical loss for small geometries but whose scale up to the size of LIGO optics is challenging; and also amorphous silicon and silicon nitride, which have attractive mechanical properties but whose optical properties must be improved."

The SGWB could also be produced by a large number of violent astrophysical events, such as gamma ray bursts or supernovae. Hence, direct observation of the SGWB would provide information about these exotic events as well. This project will allow undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars to be directly involved in this very exciting field of cosmology and astrophysics, and to make significant contributions to them.

This is an exciting time for the maturing field of gravitational-wave physics. Construction of Advanced LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory), an overhaul of the Initial LIGO interferometers, is now complete and the first couple months of data have been collected. The advanced detectors made last year the first direct detection of gravitational waves, a momentous event that will transform our understanding of the universe and marks the beginning of a new field of gravitational wave astronomy. Predicted by Einstein nearly 100 years ago, gravitational waves are distortions of space-time created by the movements of massive astrophysical objects such as exploding stars and coalescing black holes or neutron stars. The effect of gravitational waves on space-time is minuscule, however, and necessitates the design and construction of detectors that push the limits of precision measurement techniques. This award supports research to improve the Advanced LIGO sensitivity at low frequencies and increase the amount of time the detector is collecting science quality data. In addition, this program will serve as an invaluable training ground for undergraduate and graduate students who will develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines and prepare them to fill positions in academia and industry. The group is strongly committed to sharing the excitement of the field with the public through outreach at all levels, reaching out in particular to the communities in Mississippi.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves can be detected by using laser light to measure infinitesimal changes in the distance between mirrors located two-and-a-half miles (4 km) away from one another. The mirrors are suspended as pendulums to isolate them from all vibrations other than the gravitational wave. The Advanced LIGO detectors have achieved a sensitivity to changes in the distance between the mirrors of better than one-ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton. There nonetheless remain many challenges to further improve the interferometers in order to increase the rate of gravitational wave detections and expand the spectrum of astrophysical objects that can be observed. One such challenge arises from the design of the commercial seismometers that are used to provide active vibration isolation of the mirrors. The seismometers cannot distinguish between horizontal acceleration of the ground and tilt of the ground. This award supports the development of a high precision tilt-free seismometer to improve the Advanced LIGO seismic isolation. The project includes deriving updated requirements for a tilt-free seismometer based on data from the observatories, designing and modeling the instrument, constructing and measuring the performance of the tilt-free seismometer and conducting a theoretical and experimental noise analysis of the system."

One of the most extreme predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes, compact objects whose gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from them. Investigating gravity in such an extreme regime provides one of the most promising opportunities to learn more about this fundamental force. Another prediction of general relativity, that binary black holes emit gravitational waves that stretch and squeeze spacetime, was recently confirmed by the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO).  Black holes are fully described by their masses and spins, but the spins of binary black holes are generally misaligned with their orbital plane, much like the 23 degree misalignment between the Earth's rotation axis and its orbit about the Sun responsible for the seasons. General relativity causes black-hole spins to change direction or precess; this precession leaves detectable signatures in the gravitational waves observed by LIGO. This award supports studies on black-hole spin precession and the extent to which it can be constrained by gravitational-wave detectors like LIGO. This work helps scientists to interpret LIGO observations and thus better understand gravity and the astrophysical origin of black holes responsible for their spin misalignments. The PI and collaborators will also develop an interactive virtual-reality simulation of precessing black holes and the gravitational waves they emit which will be available free online and presented at local public libraries and museums through existing outreach networks of the University of Texas at Dallas. These simulations help the public virtually experience the effects of gravitational waves and enhance public interest and support for science research and education.<br/><br/>This goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive picture of the origin and implications of misalignments between binary black-hole spins and their orbital angular momentum. Population-synthesis codes will be used to explore how initial spin misalignments depend on various aspects of astrophysical black-hole formation like mass transfer, tidal alignment, and supernova recoils. The spin distributions generated by these codes will be evolved from black-hole formation until they begin to emit detectable gravitational waves using the PI's newly developed technique for efficiently calculating spin precession on the inspiral timescale. Once the binaries enter the sensitivity band of ground-based detectors like LIGO, publicly available codes in the LIGO Algorithm Library Suite will be used to generate waveforms and analyze how well the binary black-hole parameters that determine spin precession can be estimated for realistic signal-to-noise ratios. The PI and collaborators will also perform and analyze numerical-relativity simulations to assess the reliability of post-Newtonian predictions for spin precession in the final orbits before black-hole merger. This research provides the basis for astrophysical model selection, combining constraints on spin misalignments from many events to distinguish astrophysical models of black-hole formation, such as dynamical formation in a globular cluster (for which spins should be isotropic) versus formation from stellar binaries (which should exhibit a tendency towards aligned spins). The final project will consider how spin precession between black hole formation and merger affects predictions for final black-hole masses, spins, and gravitational recoils.  This project has implications both for the stellar-mass black holes observed by LIGO and recoiling quasars spatially or kinematically offset from their host galaxies sought in galaxy surveys."

The first detection of these waves in September 2015 confirmed a central prediction of one the most fundamental theories in science: Einstein's theory of general relativity. With this and subsequent detections, LIGO is now operating as an astronomical observatory allowing us to explore the Universe using a completely new sense: gravitational waves. This award provides computing resources at UWM to analyze the LIGO data and will accelerate the discoveries enabled by the LIGO instruments. The computing cluster is designed to address the specific needs of Advanced LIGO data analysis. It is an integral part of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) effort to analyze the full Advanced LIGO data sets. LIGO analysis activities will be prioritized on 90% of the cluster; other activities on the remaining 10% will include searches for radio pulsars/transients, the detection of gravitational waves using pulsar timing arrays by NANOGrav, and numerical astrophysics.  Analyses to be run on the new cluster include searches for compact binaries and related parameter-estimation. The facility will be available to all 1000+ members of the LSC, and thus will have broad international impact. Moreover, these facilities have also been used by researchers at UWM and elsewhere for interdisciplinary research in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics.  This will continue, thus ensuring that this instrument will have a broad scientific reach at UWM and beyond. The deployment and use of this instrument will also provide a hands-on opportunity for education and training to undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral scientists and academic staff in the use of large-scale computing hardware to tackle complex technical questions.<br/><br/>The baseline computational instrument will consist of 720 execute nodes with 2,280 modern E3-1241v3 CPU cores. The group will add several high-memory login nodes, storage servers (1,152 TB gross storage) and networking equipment.  Theoretical peak performance will be about 300 TFLOPS (AVX2) with sufficient storage to host all of the calibrated data from advanced detectors (30 TB/yr) and several months of raw data (600 TB/yr).  Benchmarks indicate that the cluster will be able to process over 28 million template matches in real time. The scale of this project is commensurate with a new aspect of this mission within LIGO data analysis as a secondary site for running the real-time (latency of seconds) search for compact binary mergers -- a task best handled at a dedicated site such as UWM. This instrument will facilitate and participate the discovery and the study of the exotic astrophysical events throughout the Universe that produce gravitational waves. This award will provide part of the computational resources needed to analyze the data as it is delivered by the new Advanced LIGO instruments. It will support an array of scientific activities including the detection of new gravitational-wave signals and the broader astrophysical and astronomical follow-on analyses."

This award supports studying the universe through a new field: gravitational wave astronomy. Unlike conventional astronomy, which relies on light from distant astronomical sources, gravitational wave astronomy measures tiny ripples in the fabric of space itself caused by massive objects such as black holes. A black hole's strong gravity prevents even light from escaping its grasp, and consequently, gravitational wave astronomy reveals the dark side of the universe by enabling the discovery of phenomena that were previously invisible. This new field began in 2015 when the NSF-funded LIGO observatory detected two black holes crashing together a billion light years away and has since opened a new window on the universe with more than a dozen confirmed cosmic collisions. Discovering the tiny ripples of a black hole collision billions of light years away requires sophisticated data analysis. This award funds analysis of LIGO data with the direct goal of detecting hundreds of new black holes and neutron stars in the next three years. These new discoveries will help to reveal how stars are born, how they die, and if the universe has anything hidden in its dark side.<br/><br/>The work proposed here furthers the mission of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which is focused on the direct detection of gravitational waves, using them to explore the fundamental physics of gravity and developing the emerging field of gravitational wave science as a tool of astronomical discovery. The award will deliver analysis of LIGO data over the next three years, resulting in the detection of binary neutron stars, neutron star/black hole binaries and binary black holes. These new gravitational wave detections will comprise the deepest gravitational wave transient catalog to date, with potentially hundreds of new discoveries occurring during the period of the proposed work. Each new compact binary merger will provide a new test of General Relativity, and in aggregate, the discoveries will provide a precise assessment of the population of compact objects in the nearby universe. From this population it may be possible to infer the formation mechanism of the detected binaries and in doing so reveal details about their creation and evolution.  With all gravitational wave discoveries, there is an opportunity to observe an electromagnetic or neutrino counterpart. New discoveries of binary neutron star mergers with optical counterparts like GW170817 will, among other things, deepen the understanding of heavy element production as well as pin down the expansion rate of the universe. The proposed research has substantial inherent opportunities for public engagement as black holes are often met by a captivated audience. The personnel on this proposal are committed to making a direct impact through hosting a gravitational wave summer camp in central Pennsylvania. This camp will attract a diverse group of high school students who will have an opportunity to engage with Penn State researchers and learn about gravitational wave physics and astronomy. They will also learn about the role of high performance computing in scientific discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It predicts the existence of bizarre objects like black holes and neutron stars, and ripples in spacetime called gravitational waves. These predictions motivated the construction of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which has detected several gravitational wave signals from colliding black holes and one signal from colliding neutron stars so far. For their efforts in making these detections possible, the leaders of LIGO were awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. To obtain a deeper understanding about what produced the observed gravitational waves, LIGO data analysis compares observed waves with those predicted by Einstein's theory of GR for a very large number of possible scenarios. Construction of reliable theoretical models requires the full solutions to the equations underlying GR, provided by the field of numerical relativity. This project builds upon recent advances in this field to develop new software that greatly reduces the cost (in memory) of generating these solutions. Where before numerical relativity largely depended upon supercomputers, this new software will enable even consumer-grade desktop computers to generate needed theoretical predictions of merging black holes needed for LIGO data analysis. In the latter half of the funding period, the software will be made supercomputer-capable to enable (the far more memory-hungry) simulations of merging neutron stars on supercomputers with state-of-the-art accuracy. By unlocking the consumer-grade desktop as a powerful tool for numerical relativity, this project has the potential to enable the public to participate in the science in unprecedented ways. This will be made possible by incorporating this software into SETI@Home's ""BOINC"" volunteer computing infrastructure. The hope is that when LIGO detects a pair of merging black holes, thousands of black hole merger calculations will be launched for the benefit of LIGO science, each on a consumer-grade desktop computer running our ""BlackHoles@Home"" software. To educate the public and advertise this volunteer computing project both locally and globally, the West Virginia University group will give convocations in nearby high schools and write articles for the widely aggregated news site ""The Conversation"".<br/><br/>Numerical relativity (NR) solves Einstein's equations of general relativity (GR), in full, on the computer. Improvements to the algorithmic and mathematical underpinnings of NR codes have recently culminated in a coming-of-age for the field, moving it beyond proof-of-principle calculations and into the realm of predictive astrophysics. Over the past two years, NR-based theoretical predictions of gravitational waves (GWs) were central to uncovering the binary parameters in LIGO's recent GW discoveries. Now that the age of multi-messenger astrophysics has arrived, physical scenarios involving gravitational field and magnetized fluid dynamics spanning orders of magnitude in length scale and timescale will need to be modeled. NR codes bridge these scales by dynamically adjusting their spatial numerical grids to better sample the space, but current algorithms do not account for near-symmetries in these systems or rely on complex mesh algorithms. The proposed project involves the development of a new NR code with the unique goal of being both algorithmically simple and highly efficient, minimizing computational and human effort while maximizing scientific impact. We call it SENR, the Simple, Efficient NR code. SENR is unique in its aim to perform NR simulations of compact binary inspirals atop a single, dynamical, bispherical-like spatial grid. Exploiting near-symmetries in the underlying system can reduce computational cost over the most widely-adopted NR methods by orders of magnitude, and minimizing the grid management infrastructure greatly simplifies the interpretation of numerical errors and the addition of new physics modules. SENR builds on a new, highly-robust approach in NR for solving the GR field equations with hydrodynamics on static curvilinear spatial grids with coordinate singularities (e.g., spherical polar coordinates), and the PI's team is extending the approach to arbitrary, dynamical coordinate systems. Development of SENR is accelerated by a Python-based code-generation tool developed for this project called NRPy+. Following best-practices in software design, the small SENR codebase is carefully optimized after each major feature is added to maximize scientific impact. SENR's memory efficiency unlocks the desktop as a tool for NR, enabling us to launch the first major volunteer computing effort to generate an enormous NR-based GW catalog for binary black holes. Further, SENR's scalability will enable us to leverage supercomputing resources to generate a very large double neutron star GW catalog as well. Simplicity in infrastructure greatly reduces effort required to add new physics modules, and we plan to incorporate Monte-Carlo-based photon and neutrino feedback to enable state-of-the-art realism in our compact binary simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This noise reduces the number of observable gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources. It arises from thermal excitation of the vibrational modes of the mirrors in the LIGO detector optics. The effect of these excitations is reduced as the mechanical quality factor (Q) of the mirrors is increased. Since the Q of the mirrors is limited by the reflective coatings deposited on their surfaces, lower noise requires development of better coatings. The CCR combines groups from 10 institutions in the US working on computational modeling of amorphous materials, deposition of coatings, and characterization of their atomic structure and macroscopic properties. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these three communities focused on a unified research goal. Coating thermal noise is also a limiting factor in the fields of precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and precision measurements like the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. Coatings improving on the state of the art in mechanical and optical properties developed under this program would be applicable to these communities as well. On broader impacts in education, the mixture of undergraduate institutions with elite graduate programs provides research opportunities at all education levels and establishes clear avenues of advancement for students who wish to pursue a career within the physical sciences. In addition, the CCR has a strong commitment to the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities; and will also continue its participants' activities in issues of education and public outreach through all major channels of public and social media.<br/><br/>The A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will reduce quantum noise with squeezed light injection, leaving thermal noise dominant in the mid-band of the detector.  Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with A+ LIGO's mechanical and optical requirements. Meeting this goal requires solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: the nature and control of the low-energy excitations in amorphous oxides. On a longer time scale, developing mirror coatings for the cryogenic LIGO Voyager detector broadens the possibilities to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The primary research focus is to find conditions under which amorphous metal-oxide coatings can be deposited as ""ultrastable glasses"", which have a low density of the structural motifs that form two-level systems, the source of elastic dissipation. A second research track seeks methods to stabilize coatings against crystallization during high temperature annealing, another method known to reduce room temperature elastic losses. For the longer term research towards LIGO Voyager applications, the group will investigate non-oxide coatings such as single-crystal semiconductors AlGaAs and AlGaP, which have shown low mechanical loss for small geometries but whose scale up to the size of LIGO optics is challenging; and also amorphous silicon and silicon nitride, which have attractive mechanical properties but whose optical properties must be improved."

New ways of measuring cosmological parameters will become available, which will complement existing observations.  To this end, this project supports work, identified as critical path in the LSC Data Analysis White Paper and the LSC Program, that will result in gravitational-wave detections of binary coalescence, provide rapid sky localization and parameter estimation to facilitate electromagnetic follow-up efforts, yield fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities, obtain the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger, and exploit gravitational wave observations to measure various cosmological parameters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broader impacts on the development of gravitational-wave astrophysics will consist in improving LIGO's search pipelines and the performance of the detectors.

Improvements in these areas, in turn, boost parameter estimation of the gravitational-wave detections and enable refined astrophysical interpretations of the signals. Personnel funded under this award will analyze data from LIGO detector output and auxiliary sensors with the goal to isolate and identify sources of noise affecting LIGO's gravitational-wave searches. Results from these investigations will be fed back to LIGO Laboratory commissioners and instrumentation researchers to assist in the mitigation of instrumental and environmental disturbances. At the same time, Mississippi students and researchers will develop new, fast, reliable and accurate methods to model instrumental noise in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.

Since then Advanced LIGO has continued to provide fascinating insights into the nature of our universe; confirming the existence of several merging black hole binary systems, as well as detecting gravitational waves from a neutron star inspiral and merger in parallel with electromagnetic observations. In spite of these incredible achievements (recognized with awards including the Nobel Prize in Physics), Advanced LIGO is not yet operating at its predicted maximum sensitivity. This award supports research in the form of experiments and simulations towards improving the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, with the aim of detecting gravitational wave events more often and with higher signal-to-noise ratios. Higher sensitivity observations will increase the scientific yield of observing runs, allowing us to make stronger statements about the nature of gravity, the composition of neutron stars, and the formation history of black holes in our universe. This award also supports research into technology for gravitational wave detectors beyond Advanced LIGO, so that the scientific community can be prepared to build the detectors of the future with the best possible design and components. Much of the supported work will be performed by undergraduate students, postgraduate students and recent PhD graduates. This will provide an excellent training opportunity for these junior scientists, allowing them to gain valuable skills and experience, while also serving to bolster the scientific workforce in the USA.<br/><br/>This award supports several experimental programs aimed at developing specific technologies for potential use in Advanced LIGO and future gravitational wave detectors. All interferometric gravitational wave detectors employ schemes to manage wavefront distortions in the laser beams that probe the position of the test masses, which can limit the sensitivity of detectors in several ways. Wavefront distortions will become even more critical as squeezed light technology is employed in order to reduce the quantum noise limit of the detectors. An experimental program will be carried out to investigate new ways to sense these distortions as they arise, in order that they can be corrected before they negatively impact the detector sensitivity. Another experimental program performed under this award will develop a new alignment sensing technique, which has the potential to simplify the optical layout of gravitational wave detectors and reduce the misalignment driven noise. An experimental investigation will also be pursued to determine the feasibility of using non-traditional laser beam shapes in order to reduce the effects of mirror thermal noise on interferometer sensitivity. This award also supports the development and use of laser interferometer simulation tools for characterizing and improving the operation of the Advanced LIGO detectors. Simulations have often played a key role in understanding the limiting noise sources in interferometers, and can be used to provide rapid tests of potential solutions before their often costly and time-intensive implementation in real detectors. The work performed under this award will also look beyond Advanced LIGO to near-term upgrades and longer-term new detectors, using similar simulations to help in the design and optimization of these new, more sensitive machines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Events seen by LIGO produce a wealth of astrophysical information and information on gravity theory. The extraction and interpretation of that information will require advanced techniques in data analysis, parameter estimation, statistics, and phenomenology. Detector characterization work will provide scientists with confidence in the quality of the data, and the performance of the detectors.

Predicted by Albert Einstein's 1915 theory of General Relativity, gravitational waves eluded detection for a hundred years, until on September 14, 2015, shortly after the major upgrade, the advanced LIGO detectors observed a gravitational wave signal from two colliding black holes. For the first time, LIGO detected ripples in the fabric of space-time arriving at the Earth from a cataclysmic event in the distant universe. This confirmed a major prediction of General Relativity and opened an unprecedented new window onto the cosmos. Gravitational-waves provide a direct probe of complex astrophysical systems and provide a unique astronomical tool to study the Universe. In the next few years hundreds detections of sources are expected as advanced LIGO reaches its design sensitivity and the other instruments join the world-wide network of gravitational wave detectors. The experiments with these detectors will address key research questions, including the formation and evolution of black holes and neutron stars, the role of compact objects in high energy emission, the properties of nuclear matter, the nature of gamma-ray-bursts, and the existence of intermediate-mass black holes, probing the structure and evolution of the Universe and physics beyond General Relativity.<br/><br/>The proposed research will reinforce success of the LIGO data analysis effort and support new innovative research projects that have a potential to produce transformative results. It targets the most extreme astrophysical events, such as recently discovered mergers of neutron stars and black holes, and holds a promise for discoveries of entirely new astrophysical phenomena. The proposed searches utilize the detection and reconstruction algorithms that use minimal model assumptions and that are capable of detecting gravitational-wave transients in a wide range of source parameters, including yet unknown sources. Among the primary detection targets is a core collapse supernovae (CCSN), which will address a number of open questions in astrophysics, such as the role of neutrino in CCSN and the neutron star equations of state. Also, the proposed activities will extend the most promising advanced LIGO searches for compact binary sources into the binary parameter space not yet explored by the existing template algorithms. The proposed searches have a potential to establish the existence of intermediate mass binary black holes and test the theory of general relativity at the high field regime by comparing the reconstructed signal waveforms with the numerical relativity predictions. Novel methods are proposed for studies of the compact binary post-merger signals, including quasi-normal gravitational waves emitted by the remnant black holes and post-merger signatures of the binary neutron star systems. Rapid source reconstruction and sky localization will enable joint observations with the electromagnetic telescopes and neutrino detectors, advancing the field of the multi-messenger astronomy. This award will also support the planned upgrade of the baseline LIGO data analysis algorithms for the future LIGO runs and increase the scientific potential of the proposed gravitational-wave observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime, and were first predicted by Einstein a century ago. The waves that LIGO detected were the result of a cataclysmic collision of two black holes, each 30 times more massive than our own Sun, crashing into each other at half the speed of light. This detection of gravitational waves has opened up an entirely new way for us to explore our Universe. We will learn about the very first stars in the Universe, how elements such as gold were made in the Universe, and we will also test Einstein's theory of gravity (a fundamental pillar of physics). This project is to help develop this entirely new field of gravitational-wave astrophysics, and to explore what LIGO will teach us about astrophysics and cosmology.<br/><br/>The first major theme of this project is LIGO Astrophysics. In the near future interesting LIGO constraints will arise from statistical analyses rather than individual events. For example, we can anticipate three general astrophysical quantities of interest: 1. the rate of mergers of compact binary systems, 2. the mass and mass ratio distributions of these mergers, and 3. the spin distributions of the component systems. The PI will help produce these distributions and the attendant science. This work is at the heart of the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics. In addition to this core work, the PI will engage in a number of related projects, including the modeling of spins in hierarchical formation channels, the use of Gaussian Process Emulators to model waveforms from compact binary coalescence, the role of systematic errors in LIGO astrophysics, and LIGO's ability to constrain electromagnetically charged black holes. The second major theme of the project is Multi-Messenger Astronomy, which focuses on the next gravitational-wave revolution: identifying electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational-wave sources. This will shed light on the underlying astrophysical processes and elucidate the formation channels of these gravitational-wave events. In addition, multi-messenger astronomy offers the potential to use gravitational-wave sources as standard candles to constrain cosmology. The PI plans the development of tools and pipelines to hasten the arrival of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy, including facilitating electromagnetic follow-up efforts through the continuing refinement and implementation of low-latency 3D localization algorithms and the optimization of follow-up resource allocation. This project will help LIGO reach its tremendous potential as an astronomical observatory."

While much can still be learned from the mergers of two massive compact objects, it is important to also be listening for other sounds in the symphony of gravitational waves.  Certain types of supernovae should emit gravitational waves along with light as an old and massive star collapses into an ultra-dense neutron star.  Multi-messenger observations of these supernova could help us learn a great deal about how and why these spectacular explosions occur, and about the neutron star that forms as a result.   Multi-messenger observations could also be a key to unlocking the mysterious origin of short, bright flashes of radio emission from space called fast radio bursts.  This award will also cover work in identifying and getting rid of sources of noise picked up by the LIGO interferometers that can interfere with detecting real signals from space.  This work is particularly important as LIGO continues to look for these new types of gravitational wave sources which don't have the characteristic ""chirp"" that occurs when black holes or neutron starts collide.  Annual STEM outreach work serving the Navajo nation north of Embry-Riddle, also supported by this grant, is one way in which LIGO members can share this new and exciting frontier in science with the broader community.<br/><br/>Efforts in multi-messenger astronomy, including searches in coincidence with core-collapse supernovae and radio transients, will enhance LIGO science while providing many opportunities for student involvement.  Core-collapse supernovae are an exciting target for multi-messenger astronomy. The reconstruction of a gravitational wave from a core-collapse supernova would address a number of open questions in astrophysics, including the mechanism of the explosion itself as well as fundamental questions about neutrino interactions and the neutron star equation of state. In the next few years, the improved sensitivity of Advanced LIGO combined with more sophisticated algorithms for detection and parameter estimation of supernova signals will greatly enhance LIGO's contributions to supernova astrophysics, and future interferometers carry even more promise. Another area of multi-messenger astronomy which LIGO has undertaken is the search for transient gravitational waves in coincidence with astrophysical sources of radio transients of duration on the scale of milliseconds. These could be emitted simultaneously with gravitational waves due to scenarios ranging from neutron star asteroseismology to cosmic string cusps. Gravitational wave astronomy has the potential to shed light on several types of radio emission, possibly including fast radio bursts. The search for gravitational wave bursts is made more difficult by the presence of transient terrestrial background, resulting from a combination of environmental disturbances and behavior of the interferometers themselves. Understanding these environmental disturbances and removing them from interferometric data is critical in conducting sensitive searches for gravitational waves, as it can mean the difference between a statistically significant gravitational wave detection and a sub-threshold event. This grant will support substantial effort in detector characterization, the identification and mitigation of non-astrophysical background in the interferometers and application of vetoes to eliminate them.  This award also facilitates science education and outreach at every level from high school to graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gravitational waves carry information that can tell us what happens when black holes collide, how massive stars die, how heavy elements form, how gravity works, and how the universe evolved. This group will continue the development of data analysis techniques used to extract signal from instrumental noise. In particular, the group's studies concentrate on signals generated by binary systems composed of black holes and/or neutron stars. The new methods accelerate the detection by making efficient use of computer resources available to LIGO and provide estimations of the parameters of the binary such as masses and rates of rotation. Gravitational-wave astrophysics offers exciting opportunities to inspire and educate students of all ages, strengthening both the diversity and competitiveness of U.S. secondary and college students, and improving the scientific literacy of the general public. The computational methods developed through this award are transferable to many areas of science and technology.<br/><br/>This award directly supports Advanced LIGO's mission to detect gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes. Black holes and neutron stars are nature's most compact objects and their collisions are a transformative laboratory for fundamental physics and astrophysics. The highly relativistic speeds and strongly-curved spacetimes of compact object mergers generate gravitational waves that encode the properties of the objects as they collide: how massive they are, how far away they are, and how fast they spin. These properties can then be used to understand how massive stars live and die. This award will support research to improve the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO's compact binary searches and develop next-generation parameter-measurement techniques to extract the physics from observed signals. The proposed project will continue to drive the development of scientific workflow tools and high-throughput computing that will have broad impact across the scientific community."

In 2017 the LSC, together with the Virgo collaboration, inaugurated the era of multi-messenger GW astronomy with the detection of the Binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger, GW170817. This is the dawn of a new and exciting era of astronomy, made possible by the organization and coherent vision of the LSC. The success of the LSC relies on a globally distributed team. Effective and efficient operations requires regular in-person meetings for planning and reviews. This project supports travel for the LSC Spokesperson and other members of the leadership team to participate in such activities and it also supports the LSC Fellows Program. This program attracts a diverse and skilled set of (mostly) junior researchers to work at each LIGO site. Participants monitor the quality of data during observation runs and work with local engineers and scientists to improve the performance of the interferometers. Participation by LSC members in on-site investigations helps improve the sensitivity of the LIGO detectors and increase their duty cycle; this extends the scientific reach of the detectors. Developing and maintaining a broad base of research scientists in the LSC that are trained in gravitational-wave science is essential for future observations.<br/><br/>This award supports core functions of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) in order to carry out its scientific mission of using gravitational-waves to explore the fundamental physics of gravity and as a new multi-messenger astronomical tool of discovery.

The LSC levies an Activities Fee on a per-member basis to fund key programs and functions deemed essential by the membership. These include the LSC Fellows Program, publication fees associated with collaboration papers, LSC service travel associated with organizational responsibilities, and LSC spokesperson's travel. About two thirds of the Activities Fee funds the LSC Fellows Program, which attracts a diverse and skilled set of (mostly) junior researchers to work at each LIGO site. The goals of the program are to provide opportunities for LSC members to learn about and contribute to LIGO's precision interferometery at the observatories, to have on-site LSC scientists monitoring the quality of data during observation runs, and to complement the activities of local engineers and scientists in improving the performance of the interferometers. The Activities Fee assessment ensures that the publication fees for collaboration papers, including fees to make seminal detection papers open-access, and LSC Spokesperson and other members' travel associated with organizational responsibilities, are distributed evenly among collaboration members. The fee also funds reliable internet hosting and identity services, both of which are crucial for a large collaboration such as the LSC. The LSC has a substantial positive impact on research, education and public understanding of science through its activities. The LSC trains junior scientists to understand the design and operations of the cutting-edge LIGO detectors. The experience gained through the LSC Fellows program significantly and positively impacts junior scientists' abilities to understand and communicate on highly technical topics; these are important skills both inside and outside academia.

This group will collaborate on searches for gamma-ray, X-ray and radio bursts matching up with gravitational-wave events, as well as explore how best to use the growing network of gravitational-wave detectors to search for ""scalar"" gravitational-wave bursts, which would be a distinctive sign that Einstein's theory is not the whole story about gravity. Finally, the PI will share his expertise and develop fun and educational hands-on activities for children and their parents to learn about science through a Family Discovery Days outreach program. <br/><br/>The LIGO-Virgo ""EM follow-up program"" has enlisted over 90 partner groups who have shown a strong response to the gravitational-wave events and candidates shared with them so far, but several technical aspects of the program need improvement. Building on this group's experience with the current event selection and alert generation software and procedures, the PI will help re-implement the system to be faster, more robust, easier to monitor, and ready to generate both public and private alerts during the future observing runs of the advanced gravitational-wave detector network. This group is currently discussing with LIGO and Virgo collaborators how best to manage the system design, software development and testing which will be needed. In parallel, they are working with the Fermi mission science team and LWA radio observatory users to search for gamma-ray bursts and radio transients that may be the counterparts of gravitational-wave signals, in both triggered and un-triggered search modes. According to various models, binary mergers involving at least one neutron star are likely to produce emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum, although they may be challenging to detect and to definitively identify as the counterpart. It remains an open question whether binary black hole mergers, like the events detected by LIGO so far, produce detectable emissions. To test whether general relativity (GR) is the correct theory of gravity, the PI will use a modified version of the WaveBurst algorithm to search for gravitational-wave bursts with a scalar strain polarization, distinct from the tensor polarization states which are the hallmark of GR. The group will investigate both all-sky and position-constrained (when a possible counterpart has been identified) searches; the latter can also enable a test of whether the waves travel at the speed of light (as predicted by GR) or not."

This is especially true for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) - the value of the suspension and isolation is paramount because the mirrors must be suspended above the shaking ground.  The work at Stanford is focused on the design and implementation of the mount that supports the optics for the 4-km long LIGO interferometer. The current facilities excel at isolating LIGO from the typical shaking of the ground; this grant will fund several related efforts to improve the robust operation of the LIGO detectors during large seismic disturbances, and it will also fund development of new techniques to isolate the optics of future, cryogenic detectors.<br/><br/>To improve the duty cycle of the existing observatories, this grant supports work to mitigate the impact of wind storms on the detectors by combining computational fluid dynamics, wind tunnel tests, and observatory field measurements to develop low-cost wind barriers and improved control algorithms. The grant also supports development and testing of novel control schemes to help improve the operation of the detector during large, teleseismic earthquakes. Recent work has shown that nearly 90% of the low frequency ground motion during an earthquake is common to all the optics in the detector. The new research will actively coordinate the motion of all the platforms to simultaneously minimize the common-mode drives and the differential-mode motion over the 4-km length of the observatory. The large reduction in control force, and the improvement in differential excursions is expected to significantly improve the overall robustness of the detector.  Stanford University operates the Engineering Test Facility, a 10-meter vacuum system with a prototype isolation system, where integrated hardware and software development for gravitational wave development is conducted. This grant funds research in this facility for seismic isolation of observatories which are now in the early planning stages. Future detectors are expected to use cooled optics to reduce the thermally driven (Brownian) noise of the mirrors. However, these mirrors will have more than a megawatt of laser power incident upon them, so running them at cryogenic temperatures requires the ability to continuous remove significant thermal energy. Techniques to do this will be tested on the prototype isolation platform so that the requirements for cooling and vibration control can be developed and tested simultaneously."

Under good conditions, the LIGO observatories can operate 24 hours a day, but challenging environmental conditions limit the observatories' stable operation. The improved technology and control schemes funded by this grant will help maximize the scientific output of these premier facilities. This grant also supports research to enable the next generation of detectors which may operate at low temperature, by demonstrating ways to cool the sensitive optics without compromising the extremely low-vibration conditions in which they operate.<br/><br/>This grant supports development of several complementary approaches to improving Advanced LIGO. In the short term, the implementation of improved earthquake warning schemes will enable the operators at the sites to better utilize information from the realtime USGS earthquake early warning systems so that the detectors can change from a low-noise to a robust configuration before the increased motion from teleseismic (i.e., distant) earthquakes can affect operations. The grant also supports the study of the new wind protection fences which were developed in the previous funding cycling and constructed recently at the LIGO Hanford Observatory.

Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. The Syracuse group will support the LIGO Scientific Collaboration's search for gravitational wave signals from binary star systems consisting of neutron stars and/or black holes (called compact binary coalescences, or ""CBC's""). Its special focus will be to study the ways in which instrumental artifacts (called ""glitches"") can mimic genuine signals, and to develop new tools to distinguish glitches from genuine signals. Because the gravitational waveforms from binaries can be very well predicted, some special techniques have already been developed that help make the distinction. However, these methods do not suffice for the full range of binaries expected to be seen with Advanced LIGO. The Syracuse group will develop new tools that will work on these more vulnerable kinds of signals. <br/><br/>   The Syracuse group will support the search with Advanced LIGO (""aLIGO"") for CBC signals in its first observing run (called ""O1"") with three basic approaches. Firstly, they will tune, run, and apply the special diagnostic tool called ""Daily CBC"", which gives rapid feedback to commissioners on any departures of aLIGO data from Gaussianity. Secondly, they will develop a new specially-focused version of LIGO's standard tool for investigating the statistical correlation between glitches and candidate signals, hveto; because of the long duration of CBC signals, it is necessary to implement a tuned time-shift method before asking if a glitch is coincident in time with a CBC signal. Finally, they will use related technology to implement a new statistical test that measures whether the data yielding a candidate signal looks more like a true signal or like a glitch. These techniques will enable searches for CBC signals in O1 (and beyond) to live up to their potential, making it substantially more likely that aLIGO will be succeed in detecting signals from these fascinating objects."

LIGO forms part of a world-wide network of gravitational-wave observatories poised to probe black holes, neutron stars, supernovae and the early universe using gravitational-waves as a new astronomical tool. The Advanced LIGO detectors are currently under construction and will begin their first observations in approximately 2015. The first direct detection of gravitational waves will be a watershed event in 21st century physics and astronomy. The scientific goals of the LSC rely on a substantial computational infrastructure, which spans astrophysical data analysis, detector and analysis middleware, software sustainability and computational hardware support. Initial LIGO has shown that cyber-infrastructure is as essential to gravitational-wave astronomy as the detectors themselves. It will not be possible to detect gravitational-wave sources, to study their properties, and to maximize the NSF's investment in LIGO without support for the enabling computational technologies. This award to develop and sustain Advanced LIGO's cyber-infrastructure will allow the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to be ready for the transformative new science that gravitational-wave observations will bring.  The LDG research program will train students and postdocs to be experts in next-generation cyber-infrastructure, push the boundaries of LIGO's geographically distributed, locally-available computational data grid, and sustain the operation of this cyber-infrastructure to support LIGO's science mission. Collaborations with external partners (including Internet2, Globus, Condor and Pegasus) will have significant impact outside the LSC."

Advanced LIGO?s (AdvLIGO) goal is to pioneer a new field of gravitational-wave astronomy.  AdvLIGO is an upgrade to the initial Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors and will take place over FY 2008 ? FY 2015. LIGO was conceived as an infrastructure to support a series of improving instruments, and AdvLIGO will re-use the civil construction, vacuum equipment, and environmental monitoring system while replacing the detector components at the Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA observatory sites.  The AdvLIGO design is the product of the LIGO Laboratory research and development program and the focused effort of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, informed by the experience from initial LIGO. The complete AdvLIGO detector consists of three interferometers:  one 4-km instrument at the Livingston site, and two 4-km instruments at the Hanford site. The instruments are taken through integration and test, with the prime project objective met when each interferometer is capable of being brought reliably to an operational state (?locking?) for multi-hour periods.  The Caltech-MIT LIGO Laboratory, with Caltech as the responsible fiduciary institution, will carry out the project. Other members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), on subcontract from Caltech/MIT, will participate in all phases of the effort. The UK (Science and Technology Facilities Council funding) and Germany (Max Planck Institute funding) are contributing significant capital equipment and manpower, complementing the NSF funding.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: AdvLIGO will increase the sensitivity over initial LIGO by more than a factor of 10, and thus the volume searched and potential rate of signals by a factor of more than 1000. The available bandwidth is larger, and the frequency response tunable, to address a range of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves. It is anticipated from current astrophysical knowledge that there will be frequent observations of gravitational waves, allowing a broad exploration of heretofore inaccessible astrophysics, cosmology, and relativity. Tests of general relativity in the strong field region near black holes will provide data that will help advance numerical relativity and gravitational theory. AdvLIGO will observe in coordination with other gravitational-wave detectors. The resulting observations will complement those from existing photon and neutrino observatories, increasing their reach, and giving new qualitative and quantitative understanding of the cosmos.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: AdvLIGO is the long-term focus of the entire LSC, including 46 institutions and roughly 600 members globally. In this light, implementing AdvLIGO will directly support a scientific community which came into being due to LIGO. In addition, LSC education and outreach activities of member institutions (including the LIGO Laboratory?s very active program) will be greatly enhanced by the onset of gravitational-wave astronomy -- and the new eye on the universe, achieved by pushing instrument science to fundamental limits, will inspire a generation of young people to consider the excitement of science and engineering as a career.<br/>"

The LIGO observatories have now detected dozens of cases in which two black holes, each many times more massive than our Sun, spiral around each other and merge into a single black hole.  This project will support and improve data analysis to enlarge the catalog of such events using data from LIGO's current and next observing runs, revealing the life histories of heavy stars and how they trace the evolution of galaxies and structure.  In addition, LIGO has detected two mergers of neutron stars so far.  The first, named GW170817, was accompanied by a gamma-ray burst followed by visible-light, ultraviolet and infrared emissions, and an X-ray and radio afterglow.  The combined ""multi-messenger"" observations have provided crucial data for neutron-star astrophysics and have tested models for the expansion of the universe and the formation of elements heavier than iron.   This project will maintain and improve the methods used to detect neutron-star mergers and to quickly communicate information about them to other astronomers and to the public, enabling new discoveries like GW170817 and extending multi-messenger astrophysics farther into the universe using new data.  Many searches for other kinds of gravitational-wave signals are also being carried out, and this project will support the coordination and timely publication of those results.  The project will also provide training for scientists at the graduate level and STEM skill development experiences for secondary-school students, including informal education initiatives at the University of Maryland which serve school-age children, in particular a Physics Electronics Camp for rising 9th graders.<br/><br/>This project addresses specific needs of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and its collaborative work with Virgo and KAGRA, as well as with the astronomy community.

This project will have two main areas: (1) Application of the HHT to LIGO detector characterization to study nonlinear and instrumental transient effects at a level of detail that is fundamentally unavailable to Fourier or wavelet analysis.  This includes development HHT detector characterization software and its installation at the LIGO sites supervised by PI Prof. Peter Shawhan; (2) Application of the HHT to the burst detection search for short, frequency modulated waveforms, such as the black hole binary merger signal.  The postdoc supported half-time through this award will be co-supported by NASA for closely related research relevant to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).<br/>A vital area of LIGO research is the development of data analysis algorithms to characterize detector noise and search for transient signals.  The data analysis effort is urgent as LIGO now undertakes the one year S5 science run at full design sensitivity.  The HHT is a novel method of time-frequency analysis recently developed at NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center that is specifically targeted to the analysis of transient, non-linear signals.  The HHT is adaptive and does not decompose data into a fixed basis set, and therefore it is not limited by the time-frequency uncertainty relation characteristic of Fourier or wavelet analysis.  Thus the HHT can provide very high time and frequency resolution of gravitational wave data, leading to a significant impact in both instrumental characterization and signal detection."

Gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy has entered a new era, when detected events (so far, from the merger of compact binary systems: binary black holes and binary neutron stars) will become frequent. The Advanced LIGO detectors are continuously improving their sensitivity to GWs; this will result in unprecedented rates of discoveries  of compact object mergers, and the potential for many discoveries of GWs from other astrophysical sources. Whole new classes of sources may be discovered.  These observations will enable a wealth of studies and new scientific results in astronomy, cosmology, and fundamental physics.  Observations of binary black hole mergers are used to understand stellar evolution and the formation, evolution and death of binaries. They enable uniquely powerful tests of general relativity as a theory of gravity in the strong-field, highly-relativistic regime where detectable GWs are produced. Observations of binary neutron star mergers enable constraints on the nuclear equation of state, unique measurements of the local Hubble-Lemaitre parameter, studies of gamma-ray burst physics, and insights into the origins of the heavy elements in the universe (including gold, platinum and uranium).  All of these studies are made possible through the construction and operation of the incredibly sensitive LIGO and Virgo detectors. The Caltech group, working with the LIGO Laboratory and LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), continuously improves the detectors' sensitivity, precisely calibrates the strain data, characterizes detector behavior to evaluate and improve data quality, and releases the data to the public. These studies also depend crucially on the ability to identify weak GW signals from astrophysical sources in the noisy data, using highly optimized search pipelines. We also use the scientific computing required to analyze LIGO data as a tool to engage high school juniors and seniors in the local area in gravitational-wave physics and astronomy, introducing programming and more broadly applying the scientific method through hands-on GW data science projects.<br/><br/>Our work is devoted to discovering and analyzing gravitational-wave (GW) signals in the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA detectors during LIGO's observing runs O3 and O4. The proposed work focuses on: (a) Identifying GW signals from compact binary mergers in data from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, using both of the LSC ``flagship'' search pipelines, PyCBC and gstlal; (b) using the Hidden Markov Model Viterbi algorithm to search for long-duration burst GWs from compact binary mergers, continuous GWs (CGWs) from newly-formed, rapidly spinning neutron stars in our galaxy, and other sources that produce narrow-band signals with potentially wandering central frequency; and (c) validation of candidate events (including CGW candidates) found by these pipelines, with special attention to data quality, calibration, and search pipeline specifics. We will build on our existing expertise and experience in all of these efforts, and extend them to the era of frequent detections by automating routine tasks. We will exploit our expertise in low-latency data handling, strain calibration, detector characterization and data quality evaluation, and search pipelines. The results of these efforts will make it possible to make confident detections of GW events as they become frequent, and make the information obtained available to the LSC, to the astronomical community, and to the public, promptly, so that they can be fully exploited by those communities to advance gravitational-wave astronomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LIGO is operated by Caltech (with subcontract to MIT) through a cooperative agreement with NSF. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration comprises approximately 450 scientists in over 40 institutions in 8 countries. LIGO is already operating and taking data while continuing to refine its instrumentation to reach its design sensitivity. The LIGO instruments work by measuring exquisitely tiny changes in the distances between the mirrors of the instruments' interferometers caused by the passage of gravitational waves. LIGO can already measure changes smaller than one one-hundredth the diameter of the atomic nucleus---within a factor of ten of the design goal. Gravitational waves are expected to be produced by the universe's most violent events including the formation and mergers of black holes and neutron stars, supernovae, and the Big Bang itself. LIGO's science, involving many of those aspects of physics already known to the general public---Einstein, black holes, exploding stars, the big bang---has already captured the public's interest. Leveraging LIGO science and SUBR's science education programs to motivate teaching and learning of physical science, especially in an underserved area like Louisana, could provide an important model for the outreach and educational activities of similar large projects.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Physics Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate."

LIGO's first gravitational wave event opens new avenues for astrophysical exploration and data analysis enhancements informed by direct detection. It should be recalled that the detectors that brought LIGO to success were first conceived almost a quarter century ago. Thus equally importantly, now is the time to start to plan how (and where) to build more sensitive third-generation detectors to probe the gravitational wave Universe to higher redshift. This award supports a workshop entitled ""DAWN2: What's Next for LIGO?"" which will address this need by exploring the prospects for advancing the field over the next several years and identifying the necessary groundwork for designing and implementing the next generation of detectors. This forum will be informed by insights gained by LIGO, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and astrophysical partners from the first detections. Participants will discuss how these first few detections might inform which paths offer the best opportunities forward, and how the community should begin to develop plans for the international network of second and third generation instruments.<br/><br/>The workshop will be held at the Georgia Institute of Technology on July 7-8, 2016. The workshop will have three sessions, one for each of the following topics: Advanced LIGO in the near and long term future, the international detector network and Multi-messenger astronomy, long term planning by the international community for 3rd generation detectors. The workshop will have three sessions, one for each of the topics listed above, each chaired by one of the members of the scientific organizing committee. Each topic will be introduced by ""vision"" talks from different points of view, which will be followed by a break and an hour of discussion time, generally freeform but moderated by a panel consisting of that session's speakers plus one or two others. After the meeting, the panelists will capture the ideas and consensus views that are brought forth by the presenters and the following discussion, and record them in one or more white papers. In this way, it is hoped that a clearer vision will take shape for ways to improve the scientific potential of the LIGO detectors. This should help the community focus on key technical developments and initiatives with existing and new resources."

The project aims at the development of high-precision sensors, such as a compact inertial tilt sensor, to improve the low-frequency sensitivity and robustness of LIGO. Improvement in LIGO's sensitivity will lead to the detection of gravitational waves (GW) from heavier binary sources and improved signal to noise ratio. Making LIGO robust against harsh environmental conditions, such as wind and earthquakes, improves the duty cycle for GW observation, leading to more detections, which will in turn increase the rate of new discoveries from GW science. The tilt sensors will have a broader impact in areas such as seismology and geophysics by enabling measurement of tele-seismic tilts and tilt-free ground acceleration at frequencies as low as 10 mHz. The high precision angle readouts developed for these tilt sensors have a wide variety of applications in metrology and precision experiments. This award not only supports the development of devices for Advanced LIGO, but it also serves to maintain and strengthen synergistic activities of the table-top gravity group with the gravitational wave detection community. Importantly, this STEM research will train undergraduate and graduate students in building precision mechanical instruments for fundamental research.<br/><br/>Environmental conditions such as high wind, microseism and earthquakes continue to affect duty cycle and add noise to the LIGO detectors. This is primarily due to the inability of seismometers to distinguish between low-frequency tilt and translation, known as tilt-horizontal coupling. The ground-tilt sensors the group has developed are already improving the low-frequency seismic isolation in LIGO. Making them smaller, more sensitive with interferometric readouts and compatible with LIGO vacuum requirements, would allow them to be mounted directly on the isolated platforms from which the main mirrors are suspended, reducing the low-frequency angular motion of the platform by more than two orders of magnitude.

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) project has opened new windows to observe and understand the universe. The first direct detection of gravitational waves was also the first observation of the inspiral and merger of binary black holes. While black hole mergers are one of the most energetic events in the universe, they were not visible by electromagnetic telescopes. Now, after viewing several such observations, LIGO is developing a catalogue of the population of binary black hole systems. In addition, LIGO's observation of a binary neutron star merger inaugerated the field of multi-messenger astronomy. These simultaneous observations of gravitational waves and light allow for deeper insights into neutron star structure, and they allow us to test fundamental concepts like the speed of gravitational waves and the Hubble constant. The major challenges in this field are the noise sources that limit sensitivity, most notably thermal noise in LIGO's mirror coatings. LIGO is an interferometer, an L-shaped detector with 4 km long arms, which detects gravitational waves by observing tiny differential stretching in the arms. Identical light waves, emitted at the vertex, pass down each arm to a mirror and are reflected back. Any phase difference in the recombining beams corresponds to a difference in arm length. Thus detecting gravitational waves depends on the precision detection of the surface of the end mirrors, but for LIGO that precision is a daunting one billionth of an atom width. The mirrors, at room temperature (300; K), vibrate due to thermal energy at the mirror's resonant frequencies, which are much higher than the gravitational waves frequencies that LIGO can detect. If the mirrors were composed of an ideal elastic material, these vibrations could be ignored and of no concern. Indeed the fused silica glass used for the mirror substrates is a nearly ideal elastic material. However the highly reflective mirror coatings have internal friction that shifts some of the vibrational energy down to gravitational wave frequencies. That motion, which masks the gravitational wave signal, is mirror coating thermal noise (CTN). This research project is designed to understand and reduce CTN in order to improve LIGO's sensitivity. <br/><br/>This project aims to reduce coating thermal noise by lowering the dissipation, or mechanical loss, in the coating materials. This dissipation occurs when a fluctuation in thermal or strain energy causes a dissipative state transition. This dissipative process is commonly modeled as an asymmetric double-well potential. The dissipation is reduced by increasing the energy asymmetry in the states, which lowers the transition probability. The team will investigate crystalline coatings, specifically AlGaAs, which has excellent optical properties. The AlGaAs elastic loss is very low for small samples, but further study is needed to understand the loss for large coatings. The team will also investigate stabilized amorphous dielectric coatings. Amorphous dielectric coatings produced by ion beam sputtering can have excellent optical properties, but they typically have high elastic loss. Annealing lowers the dissipation by allowing the material to relax into its lowest energy state. But annealing is limited by low crystallization temperature for these materials. Stabilized amorphous coatings are mixtures of dielectrics in which material mixture frustrates crystallization and allows a higher annealing temperature and lower elastic loss. The team will collaborate on experiments to test if the effects of annealing can be achieved by heating the substrate during deposition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This noise reduces the number of observable gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources. It arises from thermal excitation of the vibrational modes of the mirrors in the LIGO detector optics. The effect of these excitations is reduced as the mechanical quality factor (Q) of the mirrors is increased. Since the Q of the mirrors is limited by the reflective coatings deposited on their surfaces, lower noise requires development of better coatings. The CCR combines groups from 10 institutions in the US working on computational modeling of amorphous materials, deposition of coatings, and characterization of their atomic structure and macroscopic properties. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these three communities focused on a unified research goal. Coating thermal noise is also a limiting factor in the fields of precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and precision measurements like the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. Coatings improving on the state of the art in mechanical and optical properties developed under this program would be applicable to these communities as well. On broader impacts in education, the mixture of undergraduate institutions with elite graduate programs provides research opportunities at all education levels and establishes clear avenues of advancement for students who wish to pursue a career within the physical sciences. In addition, the CCR has a strong commitment to the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities; and will also continue its participants' activities in issues of education and public outreach through all major channels of public and social media.<br/><br/>The A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will reduce quantum noise with squeezed light injection, leaving thermal noise dominant in the mid-band of the detector.  Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with A+ LIGO's mechanical and optical requirements. Meeting this goal requires solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: the nature and control of the low-energy excitations in amorphous oxides. On a longer time scale, developing mirror coatings for the cryogenic LIGO Voyager detector broadens the possibilities to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The primary research focus is to find conditions under which amorphous metal-oxide coatings can be deposited as ""ultrastable glasses"", which have a low density of the structural motifs that form two-level systems, the source of elastic dissipation.

A Search for Gravitational Radiation at LIGO Oregon Experimental Relativity Group. With the discovery of gravitational waves in September 2015 via the observation a merger of black holes, and the birth of multi-messenger astrophysics with gravitational waves in 2017 via the observation of a merger of neutron stars, the LIGO collaboration has become a key player in 21st century science in the areas of fundamental physics, astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology. Because the LIGO detectors measure such tiny perturbations in spacetime -- distances 10,000 smaller than the diameter of a proton -- it is extremely sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as ground motion or background magnetic fields. During the period of this award, the LIGO instruments will be even more sensitive, meaning that the rate of detections of known astrophysical sources will be increased, and new, previously unobserved sources may appear. With this award, the group will develop the expertise and toolkits needed to meet the data quality and analysis challenges provided by the enhanced LIGO instruments. The team's graduate students will continue to play a critical role in these developments. The team will give public presentations on these exciting developments. This includes the organization of a yearly workshop for Oregon high school science teachers, so that they can convey the latest findings to their students.<br/><br/>The team will further develop the ability to characterize the coupling of relevant environmental disturbances to gravitational-wave data. The greater sensitivity of the detectors, along with the associated higher detection rates make these developments imperative. The team has developed software to determine potential environmental contamination levels to gravitational wave candidates in low latency. This is provided in the data quality reports made available for immediate evaluation for the O3 open public alerts. These tools are fairly rudimentary and further development will be needed to achieve the goal of a fully automatized process which is reliable and accurate. Continued improvement of the  instrumentation and delivery of environmental injections will be needed to keep pace with the improved sensitivity of the LIGO interferometers. Graduate students will undertake environmental injection studies and associated data analyses, as well as gravitational wave astrophysics projects, covering the topics of GRBs, magnetar flares, and supernovae. While refinements will be needed for these studies to keep pace with the improved LIGO sensitivities and better astrophysical understanding of the sources, in some cases new techniques will be needed. One example for this is for the so-called sub-threshold GRBs. The need for this was spectacularly illustrated with GRB/GW170817.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This noise reduces the number of observable gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources. It arises from thermal excitation of the vibrational modes of the mirrors in the LIGO detector optics. The effect of these excitations is reduced as the mechanical quality factor (Q) of the mirrors is increased. Since the Q of the mirrors is limited by the reflective coatings deposited on their surfaces, lower noise requires development of better coatings. The CCR combines groups from 10 institutions in the US working on computational modeling of amorphous materials, deposition of coatings, and characterization of their atomic structure and macroscopic properties. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these three communities focused on a unified research goal. Coating thermal noise is also a limiting factor in the fields of precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and precision measurements like the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. Coatings improving on the state of the art in mechanical and optical properties developed under this program would be applicable to these communities as well. On broader impacts in education, the mixture of undergraduate institutions with elite graduate programs provides research opportunities at all education levels and establishes clear avenues of advancement for students who wish to pursue a career within the physical sciences. In addition, the CCR has a strong commitment to the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities; and will also continue its participants' activities in issues of education and public outreach through all major channels of public and social media.<br/><br/>The A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will reduce quantum noise with squeezed light injection, leaving thermal noise dominant in the mid-band of the detector.  Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with A+ LIGO's mechanical and optical requirements. Meeting this goal requires solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: the nature and control of the low-energy excitations in amorphous oxides. On a longer time scale, developing mirror coatings for the cryogenic LIGO Voyager detector broadens the possibilities to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The primary research focus is to find conditions under which amorphous metal-oxide coatings can be deposited as ""ultrastable glasses"", which have a low density of the structural motifs that form two-level systems, the source of elastic dissipation. A second research track seeks methods to stabilize coatings against crystallization during high temperature annealing, another method known to reduce room temperature elastic losses. For the longer term research towards LIGO Voyager applications, the group will investigate non-oxide coatings such as single-crystal semiconductors AlGaAs and AlGaP, which have shown low mechanical loss for small geometries but whose scale up to the size of LIGO optics is challenging; and also amorphous silicon and silicon nitride, which have attractive mechanical properties but whose optical properties must be improved."

An experimental setup limited by both radiation pressure and shot noise in a low noise cryogenic environment will be developed. To achieve this in a small scale prototype, micro-fabricated mechanical resonators (of order 100 nanograms) will be used as one mirror of a high finesse optical cavity inside a low vibration cryostat, cooled to below 10K. A series of experiments will then be performed to verify models of quantum noise, and to test methods for its reduction. Specifically, a homodyne detector will be used to perform a variational readout of the resonator's position, to exploit the ponderomotive squeezing, and to evade the radiation pressure noise at a single frequency. A filter cavity will then be introduced to evade the radiation pressure noise in a wide frequency band. Advanced LIGO and other second generation gravitational wave detectors are expected to be limited by quantum noise across the majority of their detection frequency band. At low frequencies, the test masses are driven by radiation pressure and at high frequencies, shot noise limits the phase precision of the measurement. Together, the radiation pressure and shot noise represent a significant limit on the sensitivities of future gravitational-wave detectors. Collaboration with other groups within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration will provide access to a source of squeezed vacuum states, which will be used to directly reduce the radiation pressure noise. Alternative topologies, such as the speedmeter and dual-carrier readout, will also be explored. By using a combination of optical trapping and cooling, the mechanical resonators will be placed into low noise states, with decoherence rates less than their oscillation frequency, allowing for the resonators to be placed in non-classical states, as a test of quantum mechanics. <br/><br/>This research program will substantially enhance the on-campus research activities of the experimental gravitational physics program at Louisiana State University. Because of LSU's proximity to the LIGO Livingston Observatory, and the PI's other research activities within the LIGO project, there will be substantial personnel and intellectual overlap between LIGO commissioning, other on-site work, and R&D activities. Integration among these activities will strengthen the LIGO project and reduce risk, as well as advance the frontier of gravitational-wave science. Students and post-docs with experience in both small scale lab experiments and large scientific collaborations will be trained. The nature of this work naturally leads to collaboration between the GW community and the fields of quantum optics and quantum information. The thermal noise characterization experiments will have wide ranging applications to many systems limited by thermal noise. A summer research and education program aimed at undergraduate juniors will be developed, with the goal of encouraging and helping underrepresented groups in the region enter and succeed in graduate school within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. This program will contain both a research and an education component, and will work strongly with existing programs including the LIGO Science Education Center, Southern University Baton Rouge's Timbuktu Academy, and the outreach group in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to develop the educational program and to attract students."

Gravitational astronomy relies on precise measurement of the position of mirrors using a laser, and any source of noise in the mirrors represents a limitation to our ability to observe gravitational phenomenon such as black holes, neutron starts, supernova, and the Big Bang. The thermal motions of atoms in the optical coatings that cover the surface of the mirrors is large enough to be a significant limitation on LIGO sensitivity. Aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) mirrors have been used as low noise coatings in other applications that require precision measurement of mirror positions, including the most accurate clocks and very precise lasers. This project explores using AlGaAs mirrors on the much larger LIGO optics to make sure the low noise benefits can be realized in gravitational astronomy as have been in other precision measurement applications. This project does this using undergraduate students as the laboratory researchers, and exposure of undergraduate students to high end research both enhances their careers and equips them with the skills to compete in the technical workplace of the 21st century. Development of large AlGaAs mirrors can also have benefits in other applications such as computer chip manufacturing and direct energy applications to national defense. This project will also continue the annual Optics Olympiad that brings over a hundred Washington DC middle school students to the university campus. The middle school students participate in optics demonstrations, discussions with university students as well as professional scientists and engineers, and compete in a game show style tournament.<br/><br/>The primary challenge in using AlGaAs mirrors in LIGO is to scale up the size of these coatings. The group will work with vendors to increase the diameters of the coatings that can be grown and bonded onto silica substrates. They will also further study the material properties of AlGaAS, and especially the internal friction that is the source of thermal noise, to make sure AlGaAs will still be an attractive coating material at larger sizes. They will research AlGaAs internal friction using the established technique of normal mode quality factor measurements and finite element modeling. They will also share the AlGaAs samples with other members of the LIGO Optics Working Group for measurements of optical and other properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A century after Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, the two Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors opened a new window on the universe by discovering gravitational waves passing through Earth, emanating from cataclysmic, distant events: colliding black holes and neutron stars. The phenomenal precision that LIGO needs to clearly observe these faint waves requires exquisitely isolated detectors. Capturing the physics of colliding black holes and neutron stars requires accurate waveform models. This award will establish a new research group at Christopher Newport University (CNU) to address both of these challenges, through characterizing LIGO detectors to better understand the origins of problematic noise in the detectors, and by improving the waveform models used to interpret the astrophysics of observed signals. Through these projects, the CNU group will play a crucial role in improving the quality of the LIGO detector data and the accuracy of the parameter estimation information that is shared with the astronomical community and the public. The students supported by this award will be trained in computer programming, data analysis, and machine learning. These important transferable skills will prepare the students for a wide range of successful and meaningful STEM careers in academia and industry. <br/> <br/>LIGO?s sensitivity to gravitational waves is limited by non-stationary noise, which fluctuates over time depending on various environmental influences. This work will extend a method developed by the PI with collaborators to correlate these variations in sensitivity with auxiliary instrumental sensors to determine the most possible causes, using lasso linear regression. This method has already been useful for identifying noise sources that change over the course of hours, but this work will target problematic persistent noise transients, which impede gravitational wave searches and have rates varying over the course of days and weeks. The PI and students will also contribute to data quality validation of gravitational wave candidate events, to ensure that the broader astronomical community has access to necessary data quality information. The expected improvements to LIGO in the coming years will enable the observation of many more black holes, doubtless some with interestingly different properties and some potentially having much higher signal-to-noise ratios. Accurately extracting the astrophysical parameters of these signals requires comparing to template waveforms that span the potential discovery space. The PI and her students will work on surrogate modeling (a way to efficiently interpolate between expensive but accurate numerical relativity waveforms), working with members of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes collaboration. This work will enhance our ability to interpret black hole observations, especially those with large spins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gravitational waves come from Einstein's theory of gravity, and are one of the few specific predictions of Einstein's theory that can be experimentally checked against other theories of gravity (like Isaac Newton's).  Determining if Einstein's, Newton's, or perhaps some other theory of gravity correctly describes our universe is necessary to developing a complete understanding of the laws of nature.  This experiment is being performed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) with two large, four kilometer long detectors in Louisiana and Washington state.  Once gravitational waves are detected by LIGO, these detections will serve as another method of studying the universe, complementary but different from optical, radio, and other conventional telescopes.  With gravitational wave detections, we expect to learn more about black holes, neutron stars, supernova, the origins of the universe, and other high energy astronomical events.  Unfortunately, the effect of gravitational waves on the LIGO detectors is very small, and noise from other phenomenon can easily overwhelm the gravitational signal.  This grant supports work to better understand and reduce coating thermal noise, a critical noise source that limits our ability to detect gravitational waves.  The related education and outreach project is to pass on the excitement about optics we develop working on LIGO to high school students through a fun and educational competition, the Optics Olympiad.  In addition to individuals and teams competing on knowledge and understanding of optics, there will be panel discussions, a guest lecturer, and tours of science laboratories at American University.<br/><br/>Thermal noise in the coatings of the LIGO optics is caused by mechanical loss, as shown by the Fluctuation Dissipation theorem.  We will reduce this thermal noise by developing Aluminum-Gallium-Arsenide (AlGaAs) crystals and silicon nitride for use as LIGO coatings.  AlGaAs has already shown lower thermal noise in other precision optics experiments under different conditions.  Preliminary results with AlGaAs under LIGO conditions indicate some improvement in mechanical loss compared to current coatings, but not as much as expected.  This may be due to surface conditions on the substrate, which will be explored using various chemical and mechanical surface treatments.  The effects of these treatments on AlGaAs mechanical loss will be explored using normal mode quality factor, or Q, measurements.  We will also better characterize and understand thermal noise from AlGaAs using the complete description of mechanical loss as the imaginary part of the stiffness tensor.  This may allow for ways to improve thermal noise through the layer design of the coating beyond improvements from better materials.  The Optic Olympiad will include a formative assessment to determine what elements of the Olympiad are helping to reach the goals of increasing students understanding of physics and optics as well as improving their impression of STEM careers.  Results of this assessment and the Olympiad in general will be presented to the physics education research community, likely as a journal article or conference presentation."

In the wake of the currently ongoing upgrade, the detectors will be limited by coating thermal noise and, at higher frequencies, by shot noise, the statistical properties of classical fields. Coating thermal noise is caused by the Brownian motion of the atoms which comprise the dielectric coatings on the surfaces of the mirrors. We will measure coating thermal noise of the Advanced LIGO coatings, other dielectric coatings, and of newly developed crystalline coatings as a function of beam size and temperature over the entire Advanced LIGO frequency band in a fast turn-around testbed to characterize these coating and verify the theoretical models used to describe them. It is known for almost 30 years that non-classical light fields, squeezed light, can in principle be used to reduce shot noise. The improvements are limited by optical losses between the source of the non-classical field, the squeezer, and the main interferometer. One of the dominating loss mechanisms are optical losses in the Faraday isolator; an optical directional coupler for the injected laser light. We will develop low loss Faraday isolators to reduce the losses and improve the range of Advanced LIGO and other interferometric gravitational wave detectors. These improvements, together with improvements made by others in the LIGO Science Collaboration, will help to increase the detection rate and fidelity of the Advanced LIGO signals to further improve the understanding of these astrophysics signals.<br/><br/>Advanced LIGO is one of the most complex experiments ever built. It continues to push many technologies to its fundamental limits and meeting these limits gives US companies the needed edge to maintain their lead and compete in the world markets. The optical industry in the US was pushed by LIGO to continuously improve their coatings and the leading commercial coating companies are all in the US. In addition, the development of high quality optical coatings with very low thermal coating noise has spin-offs in other areas like time and frequency standards which enable potential improvements in GPS and in precision metrology. Precision metrology leads to improvements in precision manufacturing and increased shares of world markets. Low loss optical components such as the low loss Faraday isolator we will develop have commercial potential and are required in many future scientific experiments in optical information technology, quantum computing, laser physics, and other areas. The potential improvements in the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO will increase the number of detectable gravitational wave sources by at least an order of magnitude, making visible the most energetic events in the Universe and attracting new minds to astronomy and astrophysics and to science in general."

Beginning in September 2015, the two Advanced LIGO observatories, in conjunction with Virgo, have carried out observational campaigns for gravitational waves, with more than 10 inspirals of compact objects reported from observing runs O1 and O2. The just-ended O3 run detected more than 50 additional signals, most of which appear likely to be inspirals of black holes and/or neutron stars. One report of a novel source has been published, with other very interesting announcements expected. Improvements in sensitivity and performance are continuing, and Florida?s research aims at contributing to these improvements as well as to designs of third-generation gravitational-wave detectors. This work will develop national and international scientific infrastructure through the direct participation of the University of Florida LIGO group in research and operations at the LIGO Observatories. The research will go beyond gravitational-wave science. High-power optical isolators developed in this project have commercial applications to the laser and optics industries. A single-frequency 2.1 ?m laser, tunable over GHz of frequency, can affect many areas of precision science. The Florida group also gives students and postdoctoral scientists the opportunity to develop scientific skills from a diverse set of disciplines spanning lasers and optics, electronics and feedback control systems, vacuum and cryogenics, and large-scale detector commissioning and operation. In addition, the group places high value on the education of undergraduate students and each year has involved undergraduates in research.<br/><br/>Advanced LIGO was designed for a 10x sensitivity improvement and much better low-frequency response than initial LIGO. With the introduction of squeezing and the A+ upgrade, the sensitivity will be increased further. These gains require improved performance in all aspects of the detector, including the Input Optics, a responsibility of the Florida LIGO group for many years. Work will address high-power optical isolation, RF modulation, adaptive elements for mode matching, shadow sensors for sensing and control of suspended mirrors and platforms, and improved simulations of the input optics and power/signal recycling cavities. It also addresses basic research needed for next generation detectors to increase the science reach of the observatories. This longer-ranged research includes studies of impurities in silicon, a nearly ideal material for the test masses of cryogenic detectors, cryogenic shadow sensors, and the development of a single-frequency non-planar ring oscillator laser operating at 2.1 ?m wavelength.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will contribute to the advancement of precision measurement technology, deepen understandings of general relativity, and push the frontier of experimental physics at the interface between gravitational and quantum physics.  It also supports the observation and interpretation of multi-messenger astrophysical sources.  This project will serve as a training ground for early career physicists and astrophysicists, teaching them a wide variety of research techniques.

More specifically: (A) The proposed research program will formulate and evaluate innovative approaches to improving LIGO's sensitivity, by inventing new quantum metrology techniques for use in future detectors, and by studying strategies toward lowering thermal noise, beam-scattering noise, and toward nonlinear regression using auxiliary channels. The program will also explore new approaches toward GW detection, e.g., atom interferometry and displacement-noise-free interferometry. By collaborating with experimentalists, participants will attempt to make theoretical progress that will eventually make impacts in real experiments. (B) Numerical relativity simulations of binary black holes and binaries containing neutron stars will be used for LIGO data analysis: (i) Simulations following up on LIGO detections will be used to verify the accuracy of phenomenological waveform models, to explore parameter biases of these models, and to perform alternative parameter estimation strategies as needed; and (ii) Surrogate waveform models, which interpolate between numerical relativity waveforms to produce a waveform at requested parameters to high accuracy, will be implemented into LALSuite and be used in parameter estimation studies on future events.

Efforts in detector characterization such as those undertaken in this project and multi-messenger astronomy will enhance LIGO science and its ties to the rest of the astronomical community while providing many opportunities for student engagement.  Researchers supported by this grant are involving students at various levels of education, from elementary class visits, to high school research internships, to the first physics PhD candidate on Embry-Riddle's Prescott campus.  Undergraduate research remains a particular focus at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and multiple senior theses and other undergraduate projects will benefit from NSF financial support.  Embry-Riddle's LIGO group continues to increase its outreach efforts, taking advantage of opportunities in northern Arizona, including close proximity to the Navajo reservation.<br/><br/>Identification of a gravitational wave transient consistent with the time and location of an electromagnetic (e.g. optical or radio) signal will provide a wealth of information about the source that would not be available through means of a single astrophysical messenger.  Core Collapse Supernovae are an exciting target for this multi-messenger astronomy approach.  The combination of a gravitational wave and optical observation from the same supernova would address a number of open questions in astrophysics, including the mechanism of the explosion itself as well as fundamental questions about neutrino interactions and the neutron star equation of state.  Another area of multi-messenger astronomy that LIGO has begun to investigate is the search for gravitational waves in coincidence with astrophysical sources of radio transients of duration on the scale of milliseconds. These could be emitted simultaneously with gravitational waves due to scenarios ranging from neutron star asteroseismology to cosmic string cusps.  Gravitational wave astronomy has the potential to shed light on several types of radio emission, possibly including fast radio bursts. The search for gravitational wave bursts is made more difficult by the presence of transient terrestrial background, resulting from a combination of environmental disturbances and behavior of the interferometers themselves.  Understanding these environmental disturbances and removing them from interferometric data is critical in conducting sensitive searches for gravitational waves.  This grant funds substantial effort in identifying and mitigating the non-astrophysical background in the interferometers and application of vetoes to eliminate them through participation in LIGO's detector characterization working group."

Coating thermal noise research is particularly exciting, since gains made have direct impact on Advanced LIGO's detection rate for gravitational waves. If the scientific goals of the coating project are met, the detection rate for signals in the frequency band limited by coating thermal noise roughly (50-250 Hz) is expected to rise from current estimates by a factor of two or more."

LIGO is operated by Caltech (with subcontract to MIT) through a cooperative agreement with NSF. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration comprises approximately 450 scientists in over 40 institutions in 8 countries. LIGO is already operating and taking data while continuing to refine its instrumentation to reach its design sensitivity. The LIGO instruments work by measuring exquisitely tiny changes in the distances between the mirrors of the instruments' interferometers caused by the passage of gravitational waves. LIGO can already measure changes smaller than one one-hundredth the diameter of the atomic nucleus---within a factor of ten of the design goal. Gravitational waves are expected to be produced by the universe's most violent events including the formation and mergers of black holes and neutron stars, supernovae, and the Big Bang itself. LIGO's science, involving many of those aspects of physics already known to the general public---Einstein, black holes, exploding stars, the big bang---has already captured the public's interest.

This was the very first direct observation of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star in-spiral, which was accompanied by the detection of light at all wavelengths. The multi-messenger observations of GW170817 have crucially informed a large variety of fields including gravitational physics, nuclear physics, cosmology, and relativistic astrophysics. In spite of the spectacular progress, several questions remain open. A key one is whether the stellar object leftover from the merger is a short-lived neutron star, a long-lived neutron star, or a promptly formed black hole. This award supports searches of LIGO data for signatures aimed at uncovering the nature of the merger remnant. Studying how the nature of the remnant depends on the properties of the merging objects can unlock the fundamental physics of matter at densities much larger than those that can be probed in Earth-based laboratories and clarify the physics of some of the most exotic objects in the stellar graveyard. This project also supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students who will constitute the next generation of scientists, and several outreach activities aimed at presenting LIGO results to the general public and K12 students. <br/><br/>Specific intellectual goals are: (i) Unmasking the remnants of compact object mergers accompanied by gamma-ray bursts by carrying out searches for gravitational waves from newly formed neutron stars; (ii) Assessing the efficiency of the newly-developed Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA) in detecting the full zoo of possible gravitational wave signals from merger remnants, and its efficacy in post-detection parameter estimation; (iii) Quantifying the potential for discovery of gravitational waves from neutron stars formed in long gamma-ray bursts by future upgraded gravitational wave detectors. Broader impact goals are: (i) Bringing age-appropriate presentations and LIGO-related outreach activities to under-represented groups by leveraging the TTU Honors College-Bayless Elementary School mentoring program; (ii) Presenting a LIGO prize to the South Plains Regional Science Fair; (iii) Presenting LIGO results to the general public during the Astronight at TTU.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Videos highlighting the cutting edge technological advances brought about by Advanced LIGO and their impacts on other fields of science and technology may prove effective for educating officials and policy makers on the benefits of fundamental science.<br/><br/>During the course of the project, a series of professionally made video shorts will be produced for the LIGO Laboratory and LSC for education and public outreach purposes through distribution on LIGO Laboratory, LSC web sites, and the LIGO YouTube Channel.  Through an extensive series of film shoots, XPLR Productions will work with the LIGO Laboratory and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) to capture key moments as LIGO scientists work to achieve Advanced LIGO's design sensitivity and carry out a series of observing runs over the next two years. The team will produce a series of video shorts explaining the important scientific and technological concepts and issues of Advanced LIGO by the scientific experts who create them.  In the longer term, footage will used to produce either a feature length documentary film or a twelve-part series on television entitled 'LIGO' chronicling the discovery of gravitational waves and the exploration of exotic high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as colliding black holes.  Intended for broad distribution through cinema or television, 'LIGO' will bring science to life for a wide audience."

Increasing the sensitivity of the LIGO detector several times would increase the number of gravitational waves and the types of events observed. Future detectors, such as the A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will be limited by thermal noise associated with the mirror coatings used in the detector optics. The proposed work is a collaborative effort between Martin Fejer's group at Stanford University and Hai-Ping Cheng's group at the University of Florida to develop mirror coatings with lower thermal noise to address this problem for A+ LIGO and beyond. The Stanford gravitational wave research program has been involved for more than two decades in research to enable gravitational wave detectors by working closely with the LIGO Science Collaboration (LSC) to do critical research and mitigate difficult challenges. In the past, Stanford has contributed broadly to the development of novel interferometer components and design, detailed studies of the optics and mitigating optical and thermal noise, and the advanced seismic isolation systems used in Advanced LIGO (aLIGO). Hai-Ping Cheng's group at Florida is involved in computational materials simulations. In support of LIGO, she has modeled atomic structure of amorphous films and evaluated mechanical losses associated with those structures as part of a broader LSC effort to develop low-thermal-noise mirror coatings. <br/><br/>While Advanced LIGO has now operated with adequate sensitivity to detect black hole coalescences, its mid-band sensitivity will be limited by thermal noise resulting from mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings. Stanford has had a leading role within the LSC in developing experimental methods to characterize the optical, elastic, and structural properties of the amorphous materials composing multilayer dielectric mirrors. Florida carries out the current computational materials modeling effort within LSC. The proposed program is a synergistic teaming to combine these skill sets to address a critical issue to meet the design goals of A+ LIGO, developing mirrors with 2-4 times less mechanical loss than the best currently available. The mechanical losses in amorphous materials depend on subtle, preparation-dependent features in their atomic structure. Data on these structural features obtained via the electron diffraction and X-ray scattering methods proposed here is challenging to interpret, as are molecular dynamics predictions of the structure. Methods exist to use the modeling to help interpret the data and the data to help constrain the modeling, which led to the teaming arrangement proposed here. The structural data and predictions for dependence of elastic losses on material composition and process conditions, will become a major contributor to the broader LSC program to develop mirrors for A+ LIGO, guiding the others working on this problem through the thicket of possible synthesis and characterization experiments. Another long-standing effort at Stanford has been in the optical characterization of low-optical loss materials at the sub-ppm/cm level, dating back to the selection between silica and sapphire for initial LIGO test masses. The group has recently begun using the interferometric tool developed for those studies to characterize cryogenic losses in single-crystal silicon samples to evaluate their suitability as test masses in the planned cryogenic LIGO Voyager."

The project has two goal. It will provide a better understanding of the process through which the paired sites of Hanford (Washington) and Livingston (Louisiana) were selected, and of how scientists and engineers using LIGO came to distinguish background noise from gravitational wave signals. To extract a very small signal from vast amount of noise, LIGO must exclude all local disturbances not present at both sites; to maximize the likelihood of being able to filter out such disturbances from the background, scientists and engineers had to choose relatively quiet sites. Once the sites were chosen, they had to identify and understand the sources and characteristics of the local disturbances (e.g., logging activity, earthquakes, and traffic) at the selected sites in order to maintain and improve the capacity to detect gravitational waves. A sociological understanding of local life became integral to the process of characterizing local disturbances and so to the larger aim of discerning gravitational wave signals from the background noise. The novel term ?signal epistemology? is used by the researcher to refer to the acquiring, combining, and applying a hybrid of technical and social knowledge about vibrations within LIGO's interferometers. The results of this research will serve as a resource for future site selection by LIGO for the placement of additional large-scale interferometers and other large-scale physics experiment enterprises which must consider the land due to the sensitivity and size of their instruments, and it will serve as a case study that provides insights for other nationally funded big science projects. <br/><br/>This research project on the early history of LIGO has three distinct components. First, it analyzes the LIGO site selection process. Second, it examines the construction of LIGO's signal epistemology, especially with respect to the question of how LIGO's environment pertains to the operation and output signals of its interferometers. Third, it studies the importance of maintaining interferometer sensitivity and a still experimental environment relative to its actual geographic location, so that LIGO scientists can extract the incredibly minute gravitational wave from the background noise. The overarching issue addressed by the project is the perennial question of how land characteristics and placement choices affect large-scale physics experiments and how considerations of land and territory became integral to the performance of experiments on such sites. Existing literature uses sociological methods to examine interpersonal relationships in the site selection process. By contrast, this research fills a critical gap in our understanding by using archival record analysis to analyze LIGO's development, placement, design evolution, experimental runs and its understanding of distinctions between gravitational wave signals and terrestrial background noise. The project will address the experience of those who occupy the land surrounding LIGO's sites, with the aim of showing how their relationships with and knowledge of the land became part of LIGO's gravitational wave experiments and interpretation of data. The points of intersection between local knowledge and the knowledge acquired by non-resident experts entailed in site selection is a novel feature of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will fund the design, development, and deployment of metadata-aware workflows to enable the management of large data sets produced by scientific analysis.  Scientific workflows for data analysis are used by a broad community of scientists including astronomy, biology, ecology, and physics. Making workflows metadata-aware is an important step towards making scientific results easier to share, to reuse, and to support reproducibility.  This project will pilot new workflow tools using data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), a data-intensive project at the frontiers of astrophysics.

Sophisticated data analysis methods are needed to take full advantage of the improved sensitivity and make GW astronomy a reality.  Previous analyses have used simplifying assumptions about the detector noise, data calibration, and in some cases the GW signal itself, hindering our ability to make confident detection claims or accurately infer the nature of a GW signal. The research enabled by this award will advance GW data analysis by improving our ability to detect and characterize transient astrophysical signals.  The broad theme of the work supported by this award is to build a detailed model of LIGO data including instrument noise, calibration uncertainty, and GW signals.  The resulting data analysis methods will improve detection efficiency and reduce systematic errors in parameter estimation.  This award will also allow the PI to continue participating in impactful education and public outreach activities and to do so in a region of the United States which has little exposure to gravitational physics.  Outreach activities related to this award will include interactions with area high schools, colleges, and universities to publicize the exciting science being done by Advanced LIGO.<br/>  <br/>Research supported by this award will advance three main topics in LIGO data analysis:  (i) Un-modeled gravitational wave signals present a challenge for detection and parameter estimation because the signals are rare while transient noise events, or 'glitches', are common.  We will complete initial development and then continue to upgrade the BayesWave and BayesLine data analysis pipelines, which together are the state-of-the-art method for distinguishing between burst signals and glitches and drawing inferences about physical properties of the GW source.  (ii) The breakthrough technology used by BayesWave and BayesLine is a realistic model for the LIGO noise.  The deployment of this model is most mature in the burst analysis; however, all GW searches compete with the same instrument noise.  We will adapt the BayesLine algorithm to work with the parameter estimation pipeline, LALInference, for compact binary coalescence signals.  (iii)  The LIGO data must be calibrated, and there are small statistical uncertainties in amplitude and phase as a result.  Previous source characterization analyses have not incorporated uncertainty in the calibration in their data analysis method.  The BayesLine algorithm provides the foundation for modeling calibration errors and will be modified to account for systematic phase and amplitude uncertainty in compact binary and burst parameter estimation.

The Oregon group played an important role in the discovery. It is responsible for the large array of sensors which measure potential underlying terrestrial contributions to the gravitational wave signals, for example from ground motion, ambient magnetic or radio-frequency fields, acoustic noise, etc. This work will continue to be crucial over the next three years of this award, as LIGO expects to detect many gravitational-wave signals, perhaps arising from a wide variety of astrophysical sources. In fact, the other key contribution of the Oregon group is the search for one class of such sources - those associated with gamma-ray bursts. The discovery sparked tremendous public interest, reflecting the public appetite for the exploration of our universe. The publication of the scientific results from this research program has already contributed to advancement of other scientific disciplines, most notably astronomy. Finally, the education of the graduate students and postdoctoral associates working on the project will advance the technical workforce.<br/><br/><br/>The Oregon group has been a key player in developing the readiness of the LIGO detectors and its associated scientific program. Starting with the earliest data taking with initial LIGO, the group has made key contributions in the areas of characterization of detector background noise and in the data analysis techniques involving associated astrophysical signals. Specifically, on the instrument side, they have learned how to characterize the coupling of all known sources of environmental disturbances with gravitational-wave detection, and to monitor these couplings. Here, ""environment"" corresponds to any external influence other than gravitational waves. This allows LIGO to make clear statements about the potential contributions of such disturbances to putative gravitational-wave detections. On the data analysis side, the Oregon group has pioneered the science program which searches for transient gravitational-wave signals associated with astrophysical events which are well localized in time and sky position, and which are potential GW sources.

This consists of a high precision inertial tilt sensor to measure horizontal tilt independently from horizontal acceleration, which will improve Advanced LIGO seismic isolation, enabling robust operation of the interferometer under adverse environmental conditions. Research on tilt sensors will have a broader impact in areas such as seismology and geophysics by enabling measurement of tele-seismic tilts and tilt-free ground acceleration at frequencies as low as 10 mHz. The high precision angle readouts developed for these tilt sensors have a wide variety of applications in metrology and precision experiments. This award not only supports the development of a device for Advanced LIGO, but it also serves to maintain and strengthen synergistic activities of this table-top gravity group with the gravitational wave detection community. Importantly, this STEM research will train undergraduate and graduate students, and postdocs in building precision mechanical instruments.<br/><br/>In LIGO's transition from Detector to Observatory, maintaining high duty cycles is a key challenge. Environmental conditions such as high wind, microseism and earthquakes were primarily responsible for significantly limiting the duty cycle during the first observing run. This is due to the inability of seismometers to distinguish between low-frequency tilt and translation, known as tilt-horizontal coupling. The ground-tilt sensors the group has developed have been demonstrated to improve the low-frequency seismic isolation in LIGO. Further improvement by making them smaller and more sensitive with interferometric readouts, would allow them to be mounted directly on the isolated platforms from which the LIGO mirrors are suspended, enabling a stronger and direct benefit to low-frequency differential motion of the mirrors. In addition, they may prove useful in measuring seismic tilts in the gravitational wave-signal band between 5-30 Hz, allowing cancellation of Newtonian noise, which is expected to limit sensitivity of aLIGO and future detectors."

This grant supports the research activities of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee LIGO Scientific Collaboration (UWM LSC) group. The theme is gravitational-wave astronomy with an emphasis on activities on the critical path for the scientific success of LIGO. The project's strongest feature is the synergy: bringing highly-engaged faculty with a proven track record in gravitational physics, astrophysics, data analysis, and education and outreach together with undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs in a close collaborative environment to deliver gravitational-wave science and to engage the broader community in the discoveries to come. This project will convey the excitement of this budding branch of astronomy to the community through outreach efforts such as the UWM Planetarium.<br/><br/>The UWM LSC group will deliver critical elements to a low-latency search for transient gravitational waves including those produced during the coalescence of binary neutron stars and black holes. The group will help develop and operate the data-calibration system, an on-line search for signals from compact binary coalescence, and a rapid parameter estimation pipeline. Rapid identification of signals is an essential element of gravitational-wave science in the Advanced Detector Era, and will enable multi-messenger astronomy in which observations of several kinds (gravitational waves; electromagnetic waves; high energy particles) are synthesized to obtain a detailed understanding of the sources of the most cataclysmic events in the universe. Gravitational waves will reveal the inner mechanism of gamma-ray bursts, provide a means to measure the population of black holes and determine the channel by which massive black holes are grown, and probe the fundamental nature of matter above nuclear densities. New ways of measuring cosmological parameters will become available, complementing existing observations.  To this end, this award supports work that will continue to produce gravitational-wave discoveries of binary coalescence, provide rapid sky-localization and parameter estimation to facilitate electromagnetic follow-up efforts, yield fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities, obtain the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger, and exploit gravitational-wave observations to measure various cosmological parameters.  This award supports the integration of gravitational-wave science into the broader field of astrophysics. The UWM LSC group excels at educating new researchers. This project will train a new generation of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in gravitational-wave astronomy. A main deliverable is a calibrated data set for LIGO which has immense scientific broader impacts. In addition to being used in gravitational wave searches by hundreds of scientists around the world, calibrated data will be distributed to more than 250,000 Einstein@Home users in searches for gravitational waves.

This award extends the Stanford LIGO group's ongoing program on advanced gravitational wave detectors to address risk mitigation for Advanced LIGO and to provide research for enhancements to Advanced LIGO to increase observatory sensitivity. In particular, research will focus on improved optical coatings, control of electrostatic charging, and tilt sensing for the seismic isolation system. (1) The team will include new expertise in NMR spectroscopy of amorphous oxides in the earth's crust and Raman spectroscopy, to obtain micro-structural information on bond configurations in the selected coating materials. Thermal noise due to mechanical noise in these coatings will limit the sensitivity of any future interferometer beyond Advanced LIGO. Thus the goal of this research is to understand the physics of the mechanical loss mechanisms so that we can inform other researchers in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) on the mitigation of this noise source. (2) The team will also work with the LSC to develop requirements for a charge management system for Advanced LIGO.  Scaling arguments will be used to predict which sources of potential electrostatic charge accumulations might be dominant.  Numerical calculations will prioritize them and identify those that merit full finite-element modelling of their contribution to the noise budget.  Development of mitigation techniques will include research on alkali ion in-diffusion to achieve weakly conducting test mass surfaces that will allow spurious surface charges to relax to equipotentials without impacting the optical and mechanical coating losses. A localized UV LED conduction channel to allow passive charge equilibration between the test mass and the grounded frame without damage to the UV-sensitive optical coatings will be evaluated. 3) Research will be initiated to develop improved tilt sensors for increasing the performance of the active seismic isolation systems in Advanced LIGO using externally excited, passive ring optical gyroscopes which could be used to directly measure the ground rotations and improve the performance of the isolation systems which would lead to improved operational reliability of Advanced LIGO.  This research program includes participation from many disciplines including mechanical, electrical and control engineers, physicists and materials researchers.

This noise reduces the number of observable gravitational wave signals from astronomical sources. It arises from thermal excitation of the vibrational modes of the mirrors in the LIGO detector optics. The effect of these excitations is reduced as the mechanical quality factor (Q) of the mirrors is increased. Since the Q of the mirrors is limited by the reflective coatings deposited on their surfaces, lower noise requires development of better coatings. The CCR combines groups from 10 institutions in the US working on computational modeling of amorphous materials, deposition of coatings, and characterization of their atomic structure and macroscopic properties. These components are often performed by three diverse communities that work in relative isolation from each other. The strength of the CCR and its promise of accelerating discoveries arises from close integration of these three communities focused on a unified research goal. Coating thermal noise is also a limiting factor in the fields of precision timing, quantum information, low noise interferometry, and precision measurements like the search for deviations in the gravitational inverse-square law. Coatings improving on the state of the art in mechanical and optical properties developed under this program would be applicable to these communities as well. On broader impacts in education, the mixture of undergraduate institutions with elite graduate programs provides research opportunities at all education levels and establishes clear avenues of advancement for students who wish to pursue a career within the physical sciences. In addition, the CCR has a strong commitment to the advancement of women and underrepresented minorities; and will also continue its participants' activities in issues of education and public outreach through all major channels of public and social media.<br/><br/>The A+ LIGO detector, planned for 2021, will reduce quantum noise with squeezed light injection, leaving thermal noise dominant in the mid-band of the detector.  Reducing this noise source requires reducing the mechanical dissipation in the mirror coatings on the test masses. The goal of this project is to develop mirror coatings consistent with A+ LIGO's mechanical and optical requirements. Meeting this goal requires solution of a longstanding problem in the physics of amorphous materials: the nature and control of the low-energy excitations in amorphous oxides. On a longer time scale, developing mirror coatings for the cryogenic LIGO Voyager detector broadens the possibilities to include amorphous or crystalline semiconductors. The primary research focus is to find conditions under which amorphous metal-oxide coatings can be deposited as ""ultrastable glasses"", which have a low density of the structural motifs that form two-level systems, the source of elastic dissipation. A second research track seeks methods to stabilize coatings against crystallization during high temperature annealing, another method known to reduce room temperature elastic losses. For the longer term research towards LIGO Voyager applications, the group will investigate non-oxide coatings such as single-crystal semiconductors AlGaAs and AlGaP, which have shown low mechanical loss for small geometries but whose scale up to the size of LIGO optics is challenging; and also amorphous silicon and silicon nitride, which have attractive mechanical properties but whose optical properties must be improved."

In particular, our leadership in finding, describing, and mitigating noise sources which are not intrinsic to the LIGO interferometers will be crucial to the success of Advanced LIGO. And it is during this period of transition, as the new systems are being installed and commissioned, that these investigations will be most valuable.

For detector characterization, the focus will be to interrogate Advanced LIGO sub-systems as they come on line.

The program will be pursued in the two areas where Oregon has developed significant expertise and compiled a successful record of accomplishment. The first is detector characterization and detection optimization: As the initial LIGO (iLIGO) era winds down and the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) era ramps up, the lessons learned will be applied to the aLIGO instrument and the aLIGO science program. Specifically, we will understand the coupling mechanisms for environmental noise to the LIGO interferometer by way of measurement (analyzing data from monitoring instrumentation) and the development of software to better identify subtle mechanisms which gave rise to troublesome noise transients in iLIGO. The second is data analysis, especially in developing searches for GW transients associated with astrophysical triggers, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) or supernovae. An important motivation for developing and refining these searches will be to learn how best to combine other astronomical observations with those from LIGO, something we helped pioneer with triggered GRB searches in iLIGO. Furthering this development is widely seen to be crucial for the full realization of the scientific potential of Advanced LIGO. We intend to pursue this by refining searches involving gamma-ray observations (associated with GRBs) and developing searches involving neutrino observations (associated with core-collapse supernovae).<br/><br/>With the commissioning of Advanced LIGO, we are preparing for an era of discovery with the new astronomical medium of gravitational waves. Historically, each fundamental new means for observing the universe has resulted in the emergence not only of new science, but new ways the public perceives the world. We expect this to also be the case with gravitational waves. Our work will help ensure that our observational instrument, Advanced LIGO, works to its full potential, and that the new window on nature is exploited scientifically to the greatest extent possible. So beyond the scientific advancement resulting from publication of new methods and observations, we anticipate the possibility of significant human enlightenment regarding the nature of the universe to result. A new scientific discipline of gravitational- wave astronomy has emerged, and the education and advancement of the technical workforce must keep pace. The participation of graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and undergraduate students is a crucial element of the project. As an additional, direct benefit to society, we will also continue to work with high school teachers to bring this research to their students, and to engage the public via speaking engagements."

Such systems are expected, in terms of general relativity, to send out gravitational waves as they approach coalescence. The LIGO Scientific Collaboration's Inspiral Analysis Group has set upper limits for the rate of coalescence of such systems using data from LIGO's first two science runs, and hopes to be able to detect them in future runs. This award supports aspects of the work needed to fully analyze LIGO data.  One of these is the study of glitch (i.e. instrumental noise spike) propagation through the LIGO interferometer, the couplings between different channels of the LIGO instrument, and finding the channels where environmental glitches or glitches in auxiliary interferometer channels are correlated sufficiently closely with the gravity wave channel to serve as vetoes for times when triggers may have been recorded by the inspiral templates. Tools that will be used include the glitch monitor PTmon that has been tested extensively against simulations, Matlab scripts, and the LIGO tools' package Diagnostic Test Tools that displays data frames, filtered if desired. The same tools will be used in conjunction with studies of the strongest inspiral triggers that are not vetoed. The detective work involved is exciting but very time-consuming. It will be ideal for undergraduates, and offer them the opportunity of making a real contribution to a major scientific project.<br/>This award will also support the running of the inspiral analysis code to assess the triggers produced from preliminary samplings of the data to select parameters and thresholds that eliminate most of the triggers without risk of removing a real inspiral signal. Automating the process of vetoing inspiral event candidates that are really due to instrumental glitches is a high priority for the Inspiral Analysis Group and will be a part of this project. The ability to distinguish between instrumental glitches and true gravitational wave signals is a key component to the search for gravitational waves by LIGO."

Opening this completely new window to the universe is one of the most anticipated scientific events in the near future. But Advanced LIGO will only be successful if it is possible to compensate and correct all static and dynamic radii of curvature errors in all optical components inside the instrument. These curvature errors would otherwise reduce the contrast inside the interferometer, increase the losses and the noise, and limit the reach of Advanced LIGO. These curvature errors will be caused by manufacturers who have limited control over the surface figure during polishing and coating of the optics and by thermal gradients inside the optics which will be caused by residual laser beam absorption. The thermal compensation system (TCS) is responsible for measuring and correcting these errors. The TCS uses ring heaters around each mirror to change their radii of curvatures and a laser projection system to write a specific heating pattern into the optic to compensate the thermal lens inside the substrate. This award supports a small testbed to develop and test the TCS, analyze the requirements to be imposed on the TCS, and train students on this important subsystem. Advanced LIGO will be limited by the Brownian motion of the atoms which form the dielectric coatings of the mirrors inside the interferometer. Although the theory of coating thermal noise is well established, the magnitude of such noise depends on several less well understood material parameters. Direct measurements of the noise are rare, hardly systematic, and have never been done across the Advanced LIGO frequency band. This award will also support an experiment dedicated to measure thermal coating noise for different coatings, substrates, and different beam sizes to study thermal coating noise in great detail and across the entire Advanced LIGO frequency band.<br/><br/>The importance of the detection of gravitational waves for astrophysics and astronomy can hardly be overestimated. These waves are caused by moving masses which change the curvature of spacetime. This change propagates through space in the form of gravitational waves. These waves are a direct consequence of the speed limit in the universe and their exact form is described by Einstein's theory of general relativity. Opening this completely new window to the universe will allow study of the physics behind many interesting astronomical objects such as neutron star or black hole binaries or supernovae. However, the experimental challenges to reach the expected sensitivity present an ideal training ground for graduate students and young scientists. These students will gain valuable skills by working on a small but challenging laboratory experiment within the context of Advanced LIGO."

Experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) are designed to detect these waves by measuring the length difference between two paths with laser light.  The optics in these experiments are suspended in vacuum to isolate them from all forms of vibration.  With no air to conduct it away, excess surface charge can build up on the optics over time.  The motion of this charge changes the surrounding electric field, vibrating the optic and degrading the sensitivity of the experiment.  The group at Trinity University has been measuring the rate at which surface charge builds up and a method of removing the charge that does not harm the delicate reflective coatings on the optics.  Funding from this grant supports the completion of a charge removal system for delivery to the LIGO observatories and the study of the effect of different optical cleaning and handling techniques on the mobility of surface charge, and even the individual charge motions themselves.  Pursuing this research will help improve the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and future gravitational-wave detectors, for which surface charge has been a known limiting noise source since 2006.  The funding supports undergraduate research at Trinity University, where students can gain valuable experience working locally on a scaled-down vacuum system prototype while contributing to the overall LIGO research effort.<br/> <br/>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is most sensitive to gravitational waves at signal frequencies near 100 Hz.  A limiting noise source at these frequencies is surface charge on test masses, the motion of which generates fluctuating electric fields that vibrate the masses.  The noise contribution depends on the charge magnitude and the correlation time for charge motion.  This project tackles three issues related to charging noise.  One is to finalize a deliverable discharging system and assist with its installation at the LIGO observatories.  Prototype systems using ionized nitrogen gas have been demonstrated at both MIT and Trinity University, but it still must be verified that the process does not damage the test mass reflective coating.  This is done by acquiring a test mass of known absorption, exposing it to an ionized nitrogen system, and then having its absorption retested (this process has been used in cooperation with Stanford University for previous discharging techniques).  The second is to characterize the relaxation time constant and charging/discharging rate for Advanced LIGO test masses using different cleaning and handling techniques, to determine which methods will reduce charging noise.  This requires obtaining several LIGO test mass witness samples, applying different cleaning techniques (methanol, liquinox, First Contact, etc.) to each, moving them into a vacuum system, charging with a high-voltage electrode pattern, and then using a Kelvin probe to measure the rate at which the deposited charge dissipates across the face of the test mass.  This methodology will also be applied to proposed optical coatings and substrates for third-generation interferometers in cooperation with the Optics Working Group of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration.  The third is to modify an existing atomic force microscope at Trinity University so that it can perform Kelvin probe microscopy.  This will make it possible tovisualize individual charge ""hopping"" across an insulating surface, with the goal of refining the Markov process model of low frequency noise contributions."

Methods of reducing the mechanical loss in large, polished, fused silica optics through careful annealing in inert gas and vacuum will be explored. This technique has already proven successful on small, flame-drawn samples, and is expected to benefit larger samples as well. In addition, a theoretical model for the mechanical loss in fused silica will be developed in collaboration with other LIGO thermal noise researchers . Such a model would greatly aid our understanding of the fundamental loss mechanisms and may provide guidance as to how this loss might be further reduced. Finally, development will continue on a bicoherence data monitor, which is a robust method for separating bilinear noise, burst events, and chirp events from a large background of Gaussian noise.<br/><br/>This research on fused silica holds a great deal of promise for Advanced LIGO.  The PI has previously demonstrated that annealing can reduce the mechanical loss in fused silica to a level equal to that of sapphire, the other material proposed for Advanced LIGO optics and better than the requirements for Advanced LIGO. The benefits of using silica include excellent optical qualities and greater experience as an optical material. As the PI has previously shown, the loss in fused silica, when minimized, is entirely in the surface, at least for the geometries measured thus far. In other words, the loss decreases as the size of the optic increases. Therefore it is expected that large optics, when properly annealed, should, despite being polished, have a mechanical loss below the Advanced LIGO requirements. Lowering the thermal noise in the test masses will increase LIGO's astronomical reach in its most sensitive frequency band and enhance the probability for detection and study of gravitational wave events."

The high-index of refraction coating material to be used initially in Advanced LIGO is the main source of thermal noise. Past research to determined the source of excess loss in a low-index coating material allowed demonstration of how it may be reduced or eliminated. These studies of low-index material provided important indicators to guide the search for the necessary high-index coating but with low mechanical loss. LIGO scientists have studied and reduced the multitude of sources of noise that directly couple into the interferometer, thereby exposing indirect, bilinear noise processes, such as up-conversion of noise produced outside LIGO's band of sensitive frequencies into that band. Bicoherence provides a measure of such bilinear coupling while being insensitive to Gaussian noise. Development of a data monitor for bicoherence will continue under this award. Once identified, this noise can be monitored and if possible, eliminated. The bicoherence calculation engine could be adapted eventually to search for gravitational waves, since inspiral and burst signals both have nonzero bicoherence.<br/><br/>Advanced LIGO, which is scheduled to be fully operational by 2015, has been designed with a sensitivity to allow it to make regular observations of gravitational waves. Improvement in Advanced LIGO sensitivity through improved optical coatings and amelioration of up-conversion noise will allow achievement of the greatest discovery potential.

Coating thermal noise can be reduced by understanding and minimizing the mechanical loss in the mirror materials.  Traditional high reflectivity coatings are multilayers of dielectric material, usually amorphous metal-oxides, with alternating high and low index.  The materials that comprise the high-index layers are the primary source of mechanical loss; the low-index material is fused silica, which has an anomalously low loss among amorphous dielectric materials. In this research program, the PI seeks to develop a stabilized, high index material with a coefficient of thermal expansion matched to the low index material, so that the loss of the composite coating can be reduced through high temperature annealing.  In addition, crystalline coatings, such as Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs), have been shown to have a mechanical loss about a factor 10 lower than most amorphous dielectric coatings.  The AlGaAs coating could be developed as mirror materials for the 1.5 micron lasers planned for third generation detectors.  However, current samples have been limited to the centimeter scale.  This research program will explore the source of mechanical loss in these crystalline coatings including any issues related to the scaling and application of the coatings for large optics.  Finally, upconversion noise is the coupling of low frequency noise, primarily seismic noise, into the detection band of the interferometer.  Upconversion noise can be difficult to characterize because the noise peak is located at the sum or difference of the frequencies of the coupled mechanisms.  This research program will develop a data analysis tool that will use bicoherence, the higher order form of coherence, to determine the sources  of the upconverted noise.  <br/><br/>Coating thermal noise is the leading noise source in the central frequency band of Advanced LIGO and is a primary limit to overall detector sensitivity. Reducing coating thermal noise leads to a direct increase in the detector sensitivity and a cubed increase in its expected event rate.  Thus even a small reduction in the noise is important. A significant improvement in coating noise will hasten the day when LIGO will make a direct detection of gravitational waves and launch the era of gravitational wave astronomy.  Beyond the study of gravitational waves, coating thermal noise has now become an important noise source in other areas of physics, including precision optics and in precision experiments that utilize microresonators.  Finally, with the lower noise floor of Advanced LIGO, upconversion is expected to be a much more prominent noise source than in Initial LIGO. The commissioning teams will welcome a tool that can identify these noise peaks with their source.  And since upconversion is a common noise problem within the precision physics community, the development of an effective tool could be useful well beyond the gravitational wave community."

With the improved sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, we expect to enter an era of astronomy in which frequent gravitational-wave measurements are used to learn about astrophysical sources.  The inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars is a likely source for many gravitational-wave observations, and waveform models for the inspiral of such systems can be used to detect the signals using matched filtering. However, additional physics near merger is not captured by detection templates. As the stars coalesce, the gravitational waveforms will depend additionally on the properties of matter in the core of the stars. The relevant behavior is encoded in the equation of state of dense matter. Its effects on gravitational waveforms have not yet been fully modeled; while ever-improving analytic models in the inspiral and numerical simulations of the merger each contribute information, a complete picture remains elusive.  This award supports a program of research by the PI and her students at California State University Fullerton (CSUF) to understand the effects of neutron-star matter on inspiral and merger, both by constructing hybrid (analytical-numerical) waveforms with explicit error estimates and by developing phenomenological waveforms which incorporate tidal resonance effects. The results will be incorporated into the public LIGO Algorithm Library for use in realistic search and parameter-estimation studies with the full data analysis infrastructure.  <br/><br/>The proposed research is essential to maximize the astrophysical return on NSF's investment in LIGO. Improved understanding of measurement potential will inform configuration decisions as Advanced LIGO develops. Gravitational-wave measurements of neutron-star matter effects will potentially shine new light on the equation of state of matter above nuclear density, which is currently uncertain and a key research topic in both nuclear physics and astrophysics.

Crystalline silicon is known to have excellent mechanical properties and has a minimum in its thermal expansion near 120 K.  Operation at this point would minimize thermal noise.  However, many aspects are not yet well enough understood for large scale application.

We investigate optical losses and other poorly measured thermal, mechanical and optical properties of pure high-ohmic crystalline silicon and other possible candidate materials for test masses from room to liquid nitrogen temperatures.  Finally we analyze sources of noise in crystalline coatings applied to silicon test masses.  The other main limitation to the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO will be quantum (shot) noise.  We also continue the investigation of new topologies and measurement schemes for laser gravitational wave detectors, relevant to both Enhanced Advanced LIGO and beyond, and allowing us to suppress quantum noise and to relax requirements for the circulating optical power.  <br/><br/>The results of this work have a number of impacts.  The most direct is that the techniques developed can be used to make gravitational wave detectors more sensitive, and thus help derive more information about the astrophysical phenomena that cause gravitational waves.  Understanding the unusual conditions that create gravitational waves improves our understanding of violent processes that shape our universe exciting and inspiring students and the public.  More broadly, the same techniques which are developed under this research can be used in a number of precision measurement applications in science and engineering.  These include reducing noise in precison frequency reference standards to produce more accurate clocks, making quantum cryptography and quantum computing more feasible, improved tests of fundamental assumptions about space and matter, and ...  finally, a major goal of this work is to foster closer collaboration on peaceful research between Russian and US scientists. This promotes better understanding between the scientific communities in these two super-powers."

Thorne will continue his longtime role as the liaison  between LIGO and the theoretical astrophysics and relativity  communities.  In this role, he has the responsibility to  ensure that theoretical issues which need to be worked for  LIGO get dealt with by his own research group or by other  members of the relativity or astrophysical theory  communities, and that the insights and contributions of  those communities are translated into forms usable by the  LIGO Project.  Thorne's group will contribute, via  theoretical analyses, to LIGO design issues, most especially  the final design of the baffles that suppress noise from  scattered laser light in the LIGO vacuum tubes.  They will  also devote effort to the design and theoretical analysis of  advanced interferometers that could operate in LIGO in the  mid 2000s or later.    Among the issues that Thorne and his group will deal with  during the four years of this award are these:    They will develop and implement numerical algorithms for  searching for gravitational-wave signals in the LIGO data,  and for extracting information from detected signals.  The  greatest effort will go into search and analysis algorithms  for inspiraling and coalescing compact binaries (binary  systems made from neutron stars and/or black holes).  These  algorithms will be based on:  (i)  theoretical inspiral  waveforms, (ii) theoretical black-hole coalescence  waveforms, and (iii) theoretical neutron-star coalescence  waveforms.

The research will focus on the development of techniques for future LIGO interferometers that will operate in the LIGO facilities after the first interferometers have completed their studies.<br/><br/>One of the key problems in the LIGO interferometers is the reduction of noise in the suspensions of the test-masses.  This noise reduction can be achieved by developing the highest possible quality factors for the suspensions' pendulum and violin modes and by suppressing excess (non-thermal, non-Gaussian) noise of various sorts.  The members of the MSU group have made substantial progress in this direction over the last five years.  Their past studies revealed a number of new aspects of suspension noise and fabrication that will be important for future LIGO interferometers.  Following up on the previous results, they have chosen the principal goals of the research to be done under this grant to be:<br/><br/>  I.     To realize further improvements of the quality-factors of the pendulum and violin modes of the suspensions (Q-factors greater than about 100 million are expected).  These will be achieved by the identification and reduction of a variety of dissipation mechanisms, including losses caused by electric and magnetic fields that actuators apply to the test masses, and surface losses in the suspension fibers.<br/><br/>  II.    To carry out experimental and theoretical investigations of excess noise in suspension fibers at a level which is much less than thermal equilibrium energies.<br/><br/>The MSU group has also worked in the past on ""quantum non-demolition"" techniques for precision measurements.  In collaboration with Professor Thorne of Caltech they will pursue a third goal:<br/><br/>  III.   To devise and to analyze theoretically schemes for gravitational-wave antennae in LIGO, and readout systems which can overcome the ""standard quantum limit"" while using light power that is low enough to be practical.<br/><br/>The grant provides for travel funds so the Moscow group can transfer to the LIGO team the techniques, and technology that they develop for high-Q fused silica suspension systems, and for the reduction of various kinds of dissipation and excess noise in the test masses and their suspensions.  The Moscow group will also provide advice to the LIGO team about various aspects of the LIGO interferometer R&D program, including R&D for enhancements of the first LIGO interferometers.<br/>*** <br/>"

In addition, the proposal looks forward to an interesting analysis program to correlate gamma ray bursts (observed for a number of years, but still not understood) with gravity waves that LIGO expects to observe when the LIGO upgrade is completed.

Using the end-to-end (e2e) simulation package developed by the LIGO Laboratory simulation group at the California Institute of Technology, various programs will be built to simulate the input optics (IO), the chain of optics located between the laser source and the interferometer. These programs will take floor motions and the electric field of the laser beam entering the IO part as inputs, and compute the resultant motions of the optics and the electric field of the output beam from the IO. To make the numerical simulation realistic, actual signals recorded at LLO will be used for the mechanical and optical inputs. The output of the simulation will be compared with the corresponding signal recorded at LLO concurrently with the input. On confirming the validity, these programs will be incorporated into SimLIGO, the e2e program currently developed by the LIGO Laboratory simulation group to simulate the whole LIGO detector. The current version of SimLIGO is not equipped with a dynamic model of IO. With the resultant program, numerical experiments will be performed to study lock-loss and other effects of the floor motion on the interferometer performance. <br/><br/>The involvement of Southeastern Louisiana University undergraduate students is an important element of this project. The educational objectives of this project will be realized in two broad ways: by actively involving undergraduate students as researchers and by using the products of the research as tools in the lecture classes. The goal of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the initiation of their study to understand the properties of the astronomical systems that produce them. This project will contribute to LIGO  in several ways. The developed simulation programs can be used to modify the design of the control systems, to obtain indirect measurements of properties of subsystems that cannot be measured directly, and to inform the development of other aspects of the simulation programs. <br/>"

In the next five years the PI will: (1) supervise graduate students, active in LIGO core science, in her group and as task leader in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC); (2) establish a mentoring program to support scientific and professional development of graduate students across the LSC, with the support of the LIGO Academic Advisory Council, of which she is member; (3) design a new course on introductory data analysis techniques for UMass graduate students and advanced undergraduates in astrophysics and particle physics. For a broader outreach, this outreach will also support the deployment of a program on supernovae, black holes and gravitational waves, with lectures and hands-on activities. This will add an astrophysics component to UMass STEM activities like the after-school STEM-RAY and the Saturday Seminar series for teachers.

Some of the most exciting advancements in our understanding of the universe can come from joint observations of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals, as was evident from the detection of merging neutron stars in August of 2017 by the LIGO and Virgo Scientific Collaborations as well as electromagnetic telescopes around the world.  This project will enable prompt follow-up of detected gravitational-wave signals with electromagnetic telescopes by increasing the speed and accuracy with which gravitational-wave data from the LIGO detectors can be calibrated and disseminated to astrophysical analyses.  In addition to enabling the advancements in science that will be obtained from prompt multi-messenger astronomy, this project will also shepherd the next generation of scientists into this exciting field.  The project funds the development and expansion of a Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group that serves as a no-barrier-to-entry research opportunity for high school and early-career undergraduate students at Kenyon College and in the surrounding community.  This group has already launched several undergraduates into LIGO-related research projects, and this project will allow that pipeline to expand and improve access to a wide range of students.<br/><br/>The first step in gravitational-wave data analysis is the accurate and prompt reconstruction, or calibration, of the detector strain h(t). Currently the calibrated strain data is available to quick-response gravitational-wave searches in approximately 10 seconds with minimal information about the quality of the detector data. This project will propel LIGO data production into the future with very low-latency calibrated strain data, subtraction of noise in the calibrated strain data, and robust information about the quality of the strain data. This transformed data product would then be at the fingertips of quick-response gravitational-wave searches, thereby improving the ability of these searches to both find and quantify gravitational waves in the data.  The project incorporates undergraduates and high school students into this cutting-edge field.  Undergraduate students will be involved in implementing low-latency methods for removing noise from the strain data and using machine learning algorithms to provide predictions about the probability of loud, transient noise events being present in the data.  High school students and early undergraduate students will be initiated into the fields of astronomy and gravitational-wave physics through the Radio and Optical Astronomy Research (ROAR) group at Kenyon College.  ROAR students will perform astronomy observations and pulsar candidate identification that will contribute to the field of pulsar timing.  This program thereby establishes a research pipeline through which students can engage early in research opportunities and transition into advanced research areas.

This award sponsors the development of novel compact seismic sensing technologies that provide highly sensitive observations of slow seismic phenomena on platforms under extreme conditions such as low pressures (vacuum) and low temperatures (cryogenics). In this project, parameters of sensitivity and bandwidth will be studied to develop optomechanical seismic sensors that are compatible with and can be installed in future gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO Voyager. Seismic sensors are used to measure external disturbances acting on the platforms and provide signals than can be used to stabilize them. Moreover, the research conducted in this project will advance the development of technologies that enable further advancements relevant to other scientific and technological areas such as seismology, geodesy, precision measurements of vibrations, generally inertial sensing and inertial navigation, where highly compact form factors and high sensitivities can be advantageous. This award will support the participation of this research group in activities of the international LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the gravitational wave community at large; also providing for students to be trained in precision measurements and STEM areas, and helping to educate the local community in the new area of gravitational wave astronomy.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop highly compact monolithic optomechanical seismic sensors for ground-based gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO, as an alternative to current solutions. LIGO currently uses commercial seismometers that are not readily compatible with vacuum or low temperature environments and are physically large - approximately 15 kg and 30 liters. Inertial sensors capable of operating in these conditions are required for future gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO Voyager, and need to be developed, which is the goal of this project. In addition, the research plan envisions the development of an optomechanical seismic sensing instrument that will serve as a test platform to assess relevant sensor parameters to guide the technology development and help study their performance at low frequencies - from 10 mHz to slightly above 10 Hz. These results will outline the path for the development of cryogenic- and vacuum-compatible optomechanical seismic sensors for future generation gravitational wave observatories and will be relevant to many other STEM areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two years ago, the historic detection of colliding neutron stars sent physical and figurative waves through the scientific community. Shortly after, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration made the first direct measurement of the neutron star equation of state from gravitational waves. Many more binary neutron star mergers will be seen as ground-based interferometers continue operating and increasing in sensitivity. This promises to provide even tighter constraints on the equation of state. A critical component of this process will be developing the software infrastructure for modeling and measuring the neutron star equation of state.  The Kenyon College LIGO group will develop and incorporate a full suite of equation of state models available not only to the collaboration, but also available to the broader scientific community who rely on these results for followup analyses. This award intimately involves undergraduates in LIGO research and supports a no-barrier-to-entry astronomy research program that can recruit and bridge students into important LIGO research.<br/><br/>This award focusses on four types of equation of state models that will be used for parameter estimation: 1) piecewise polytopic models, 2) spectral decompositions of the adiabatic index, 3) models with built-in sharp, first-order phase transitions, and 4) models with nuclear physics parameters. Polytropic and spectral decomposition models have already been incorporated into lalsuite, which is LIGO?s algorithm library. However, they still require important development to make them more robust, which are great projects for training young undergraduates for more substantial research. Models with phase transitions and nuclear physics parameters have not yet been incorporated into lalsuite and will require a lot of development to get working seamlessly with the collaboration?s flagship parameter estimation software. Both sets of projects, though varying in required development, are essential additions for interpreting the physics of neutron star interiors.  These projects could potentially lead to conclusive evidence of a first-order phase transition in the neutron star equation of state.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The detection of GWs from the binary neutron star merger, GW170817, when combined with the coincident GRB detection, GRB 170817A, and the electromagnetic follow-up campaign that discovered associated afterglows across the electromagnetic spectrum, has had a significant impact on the understanding of the progenitors of short GRBs, kilonovae, and the equation of state of neutron stars. This collection of observations and discoveries has demonstrated the capabilities of multi-messenger astronomy with the addition GWs.  These successes of the first and second Observing Runs of The Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and the French-Italian Virgo detector are now being expanded upon, as these detectors began observing the universe at sensitivities never before achieved in their third Observing Run, starting in April of 2019.  This award will support the search for GWs associated with new GRB events, for which only one coincident detection has so far been made.  The award will also support the search for GWs associated with fast radio bursts (FRB), which are extremely short-lived and extremely energetic bursts radio waves first detected by radio telescopes in 2007.  The progenitors of FRBs are completely unknown, and many astronomers are actively trying to detect more of these events to learn what might cause them.  Any detection of a GW associated with a FRB would result in a significant increase in the understanding of the astrophysical origin of these mysterious events.  The award will support the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through the training of undergraduate and masters students to become competent scientific researchers able to conduct research at the internationally recognized level as the next generation of gravitational-wave astronomers.<br/><br/>As was demonstrated with the multi-messenger observations of GW170817, combined detections of GWs with electromagnetic detections have significantly advanced the understanding of astrophysics of high-energy events.  This award will support the search for GWs associated with GRBs using a coherent, matched-filter search for compact binary coalescence sources.  These searches will be conducted in response to announced GRB detections, and any GWs detected will be announced to the astronomical community for prompt follow-up. This search extends the effective sensitivity of the GW detection network beyond that of an all-sky search by using the information provided by the external trigger's sky location.  Additional detections of GWs associated with GRBs in the third and fourth observing runs of LIGO and complimentary Virgo data will enable the astrophysical properties of neutron stars to be better constrained. Additionally, the full electromagnetic emission model for these binary neutron star merger sources will be refined with future multi-messenger observations.  This award will also support the coherent, template-based search for GWs associated with fast radio bursts (FRB).  Currently, the models of FRB progenitors are poorly constrained, and very few candidate progenitor sources have been eliminated due to a combination of the paucity of bursts detected thus far and a lack of multispectral observations. If a GW were detected with a template-based search in LIGO and Virgo data and found to be associated with a FRB, this would immediately indicate that the source of FRBs are binary neutron star mergers or neutron star-black hole mergers. At the same time, if no coincident detections are made in this search, this will better constrain models of the FRB progenitors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gravitational waves (GW) have been directly detected in 2015. So far, two different types of sources have been detected, viz. binary black holes and binary neutron stars. However, there is a wide repertoire of potential sources yet to be detected. The third generation of GW detectors are also in the offing. To address these new challenges in the next decade, this award supports experimental innovations and novel detector characterization and data analysis techniques to further enhance probability of detection of new sources and further extend the GW visibility field. Core collapse supernovae (CCSN) are one of such highly anticipated yet equally challenging sources. The science payoffs from such a detection will be huge, but it dares to elude us because of the low occurrence rates and weak signal strengths. The award will implement a new technique that, based on recent studies, is expected to enhance the detection sensitivity of CCSN. At the same time, further data quality studies will be conducted to study and mitigate noise generated by turbulent airflow. On the instrumental side, research will be conducted to calculate the length response from the advanced LIGO detectors to better understand the high frequency response. While this research will reflect on fundamental understanding of a wide variety of issues, it will also be a great opportunity to train the undergraduate and graduate students in GW research and strengthen STEM workforce. The algorithms and numerical models that will be developed during this study will have a broader application beyond the GW data analysis. <br/><br/>With the upcoming O3 run of the LIGO detectors, it is anticipated the detection of other types of sources and even unknown ones. With the goal of significantly increasing the science reach of the advanced detectors, the UTRGV team will work on projects in the following major areas. 1. Noise characterization: the development of a numerical model to generate realistic finely-sampled temperature fields and run a full hydrodynamic simulation, to determine the frequency distribution of turbulent vortices, and to see how turbulent airflow acts back on the temperature field. 2. Instrumentation research: studies of the aLIGO interferometer configuration in the interferometer model, and evaluating the residual uncertainties at high frequencies. 3. Efficient methods for GW emission from core collapse supernovae: development and application of innovative data analysis algorithms geared towards enhancement of efficiency in detecting weak unmodeled GW signals from core collapse supernovae burst sources. A data pre-processing method (called ""TSD""), derived from the Harmonic Regeneration Noise Reduction (HRNR) technique, will be integrated with existing network analysis pipelines to boost their sensitivity to post-core-bounce-phase supernova signals, followed by characterization of performance enhancement and waveform reconstruction for such signals injected in observation-run data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the most important open problems in LIGO noise reduction is related to the coatings of the mirrors used in the interferometer. Advances in precision optical measurement have made it possible to measure the thermal fluctuations of macroscopic materials. Thermal fluctuations in mechanical systems which occur at the atto-meter scale, and are known as ""thermal noise"", are a limiting noise source in gravitational wave detectors and in the best frequency references.  This work will expand the scope of an ongoing experiment at MIT which was used to measure the thermal noise of Advanced LIGO mirrors.  The new scope will include characterizing potential replacements for the coatings currently used in gravitational wave detectors.<br/><br/>The founding principle of the experiments supported by this award is that the thermal noise experienced by different spatial modes of a resonant cavity is easily separated from most technical noises, making a high signal to noise measurement possible in a tabletop experiment. These studies will test new materials used for ion-beam-sputtered (IBS) coatings, searching for new promising candidates to replace the coatings currently used by LIGO. Research in the area of coating thermal noise will allow us to extend the reach of gravitational wave detectors, make more precise clocks, and probe more deeply the quantum nature of opto-mechanical interactions.  Since the proposed work will have a strong influence on the design of future gravitational wave detectors, its urgency cannot be overstated."

Among the key predictions of the theory is the existence of gravitational waves: ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The detection of continuous gravitational waves from rotating neutron stars would be especially interesting because many such sources are expected to continue emitting for long durations, allowing follow-up investigation of increasing precision, and because it is believed that these waves will provide insight into the poorly known structure of these exotic stars. The research to be carried out, on both the instrumental and analytical sides, will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art science at the frontier of knowledge.<br/><br/>Research will focus on a number of specific areas related to the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) Experiment: 1) co-leading the ongoing LIGO Scientific Collaboration's search for continuous gravitational waves; 2) carrying out searches for those waves from both isolated and binary neutron stars using programs developed previously by the University of Michigan gravitational waves group; 3) developing new search algorithms with improved sensitivity and computational efficiency; and 4) detector characterization of Advanced LIGO interferometers focused on spectral line identification and mitigation."

This award sponsors the development of novel compact seismic sensing technologies that provide highly sensitive observations of slow seismic phenomena on platforms under extreme conditions such as low pressures (vacuum) and low temperatures (cryogenics). In this project, parameters of sensitivity and bandwidth will be studied to develop optomechanical seismic sensors that are compatible with and can be installed in future gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO Voyager. Seismic sensors are used to measure external disturbances acting on the platforms and provide signals than can be used to stabilize them. Moreover, the research conducted in this project will advance the development of technologies that enable further advancements relevant to other scientific and technological areas such as seismology, geodesy, precision measurements of vibrations, generally inertial sensing and inertial navigation, where highly compact form factors and high sensitivities can be advantageous. This award will support the participation of this research group in activities of the international LIGO Scientific Collaboration and the gravitational wave community at large; also providing for students to be trained in precision measurements and STEM areas, and helping to educate the local community in the new area of gravitational wave astronomy.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop highly compact monolithic optomechanical seismic sensors for ground-based gravitational wave observatories, such as LIGO, as an alternative to current solutions. LIGO currently uses commercial seismometers that are not readily compatible with vacuum or low temperature environments and are physically large - approximately 15 kg and 30 liters. Inertial sensors capable of operating in these conditions are required for future gravitational wave detectors, such as LIGO Voyager, and need to be developed, which is the goal of this project. In addition, the research plan envisions the development of an optomechanical seismic sensing instrument that will serve as a test platform to assess relevant sensor parameters to guide the technology development and help study their performance at low frequencies - from 10 mHz to slightly above 10 Hz. These results will outline the path for the development of cryogenic- and vacuum-compatible optomechanical seismic sensors for future generation gravitational wave observatories and will be relevant to many other STEM areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The enhanced searches for transient gravitational wave signals will employ the powerful technique of constrained signal reconstruction using data from a network of gravitational wave detectors. A key element of this approach is the development of constraints that describe prior knowledge of the signals. Information from numerical simulations of black hole mergers and core collapse supernovae will be used to construct source specific prior input. Once a detection has been made it is important that the signal be characterized values established for the parameters that describe the signal. This will be done through implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling routines to study spinning black hole inspiral signals and un-modeled burst signals. These implementations will be integrated into the standard LIGO search pipelines using the existing infrastructure to compute signal likelihoods. These studies will be carried out in close collaboration with the LIGO Scientific Collaboration data analysis working groups. <br/><br/>The majority of the gravitational wave signals that LIGO hopes to detect would pass by unnoticed, hidden in the instrument noise, without sophisticated data analysis techniques.

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) is now repeatedly detecting gravitational waves (GWs)---ripples in space and time---emitted by the collision of compact objects millions, sometimes billions, of light-years from Earth. Most of these objects have been black holes, others have been neutron stars. From the GWs, scientists can measure properties (locations, masses, spins) of the objects and learn about how they might have formed and how they warp space and time as they collide; for neutron stars, the collision also produces gamma-rays and other electromagnetic radiation, and together with the GWs this teaches scientists how matter behaves at ultra-high densities and how some chemical elements were formed.  But these studies require comparing the detected GWs with detailed predictions of the waves. The predictions are made using the equations of General Relativity, written down by Einstein in 1915 but unsolvable (for colliding compact objects) until about 2005 with the development of advanced methods and powerful supercomputers. This project supports theoretical work designed to underpin and improve LIGO's ability to extract from observed GWs the rich information that the waves carry, and to improve the interpretation of LIGO events with electromagnetic counterparts. This includes the improvement and use of the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC), currently the most accurate computer code for solving Einstein's equations for black hole binaries. SpEC will be used to carry out numerical solutions of black-hole collisions for the purpose of analyzing LIGO data.  In addition, a next-generation computer code SpECTRE, under development, will be used to predict GWs from two colliding neutron stars and from a black hole colliding with a neutron star, and will be used to study accretion disks that form after the merger.  This program will also serve as a training ground for young physicists and astrophysicists. The new code SpECTRE and its output will be publicly released.  The group members will reach out to the general public through lectures, interactive web pages, and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>By combining analytical techniques and numerical simulations with the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC): (i) GW signals for BBHs will be generated for use in LIGO data analysis in poorly-explored regions of the BBH parameter space, and will be used to produce numerical surrogate models that can evaluate a single waveform in milliseconds while retaining the accuracy of full numerical simulations; and (ii) the dynamical behavior of highly curved spacetime will be explored via analytic, perturbative, and numerical approaches, which will include studies of quasinormal mode excitations, exotic compact objects, beyond-Einstein theories of gravitation, and extreme mass ratio inspirals.

Research on high power lasers, photo-detectors, and optical configurations that reliably handle high power will be continued toward enhancing LIGO sensitivity at high frequencies.  Studies on understanding and minimizing thermal noise in the detector's core optics will be pursued to enhance sensitivity at intermediate frequencies.

Laser interferometer detectors, which operate by measuring strains in the fabric of space-time that are expected to be produced by gravitational waves, are now becoming operational and may soon give us a first detection. Detectors of higher performance, such as Advanced LIGO, should allow us to develop gravitational wave astronomy as a new window on the Universe.

This is done not only as part of the dynamical studies but also for communicating the science of gravitational-wave sources to the general public.<br/><br/>The specific projects pursued in this time frame are a mix of studies using black hole perturbation theory, and studies in support of astronomy with the LIGO gravitational wave detectors. Black hole perturbation theory will be studied in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Maryland and Germany to revise and extend the very successful ""effective one body"" (EOB) approach to compact binary dynamics. Work in this program so far has done much to clarify how interactions with a black hole's event horizon affect the evolution of compact binary. Future work will begin to probe orbits with substantial spin-orbit misalignment, laying the groundwork for using the EOB framework on a larger family of astrophysically relevant orbits. Black hole perturbation theory will also be used to understand as precisely as possible how a black hole is distorted by an orbiting body, and how momentary resonances between orbital frequencies can change the system's evolution. In the domain of gravitational wave astronomy, neutron star fluid instabilities will be studied to find out whether they can significantly affect the ability of LIGO and sister instruments to detect binary inspiral. Even if the claimed effect turns out to be incorrect, this will be a valuable exercise in assessing how robust are the techniques that will be used for binary inspiral. Another project will investigate how precisely the calibration of each LIGO instrument must be known in order to accurately pin down the sky position of coalescing binaries. Searching for counterparts to these events with telescopes has become an extremely hot topic in recent years; making sure that LIGO can accurately tell telescopes where to look is crucial for insuring that these searches are fruitful."

First, they will use the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) to model merging black holes and neutron stars--the most promising sources for Advanced LIGO--focusing on the challenging but astrophysically important case of rapid black-hole spins. The resulting simulated gravitational waveforms will help maximize LIGO's reach, in part by leading to better approximate waveform models for future LIGO searches; the simulations will also reveal how warped spacetime behaves under extreme conditions never before modeled.  Second, the PI and student researchers will use high-performance computing to model thermal noise--one of the most significant fundamental limits to detectors' astrophysical sensitivities--focusing on a highly promising avenue for improvement, crystalline mirror materials. Leveraging these highly sophisticated techniques will allow for breakthroughs in the understanding of the fluctuations in complex elastic structures, including mirrors with crystalline coatings.

Combined with deep learning algorithms, parallelized processing architectures, in particular, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have been shown to give large speedups in computing when compared with conventional CPUs. This project aims to bring machine learning based accelerated computing with FPGAs into the scientific community by targeting two big-data physics experiments: the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave  Observatory (LIGO).

The detection was an important validation for General Relativity in both its confirmation of the existence of gravitational waves and in the accuracy of the predicted waveforms. The event was also a breakthrough in astronomy with the first direct detection of a black hole binary system. The era of gravitational wave astronomy has begun and with it comes increased expectations for more observations at greater sensitivity. The main obstacle to improved sensitivity is thermal noise in LIGO's mirror coatings. LIGO senses gravitational waves using an interferometer, an L-shaped detector with 4 km long arms. Identical light waves are sent from the vertex down orthogonal arms to a mirror. When the reflected beams recombine at the vertex the difference in phase corresponds to the arm length difference that can arise, in part, from gravitational waves. Thus the detection of gravitational waves depends on the precision detection of the surface of the end mirrors. LIGO operates at room temperature or 300; above absolute zero. Therefore the mirrors are relatively hot. That thermal energy is expressed as vibrations at the mirror's resonant frequencies. Those frequencies are much higher than the frequencies at which LIGO is designed to detect gravitational waves. If the mirrors were composed of ideal elastic materials, these vibrations would be ignored and of no concern. Indeed the special glass used for the mirror substrates is a nearly ideal elastic material. However the highly reflective mirror coating applied to the substrate has enough internal friction that it shifts some of the mirror's vibrational energy down to gravitational wave frequencies. That motion masks the gravitational wave signal and is termed mirror coating thermal noise. The goal of this research project is to produce a mirror coating with suffi;ciently reduced thermal noise in order to enable a significant increase in LIGO's sensitivity. <br/><br/>This award supports research to reduce coating thermal noise by lowering the dissipation, or mechanical loss, in the coating materials. This dissipation occurs when an oscillation in strain causes a state transition, such as a bond angle rotation, that emits a photon or phonon at de-excitation. This two state model is known as an asymmetric double-well potential. The dissipation is reduced by increasing the energy asymmetry in the states and thus lowering the transition probability. Annealing lowers dissipation by allowing the material to relax into its lowest energy state. It also reduces density fluctuations thereby raising the transition energy. But annealing is limited by low crystallization temperatures. Amorphous coatings are mixtures of high-index metal-oxide dielectrics in which the crystallization temperature is shifted above the effective annealing temperature. Recent advanced in work on amorphous silicon coatings show that the benefits of annealing can be obtained by depositing the coating on a heated substrate. Because the coating surface molecules are less constrained, the substrate temperatures are much less than the bulk annealing temperatures. The group will test this process in amorphous metal-oxide coatings and will investigate whether ion-assisted beam deposition might provide suffi;cient energy to the surface layer to effectively anneal the coating without any heating process. Finally, the group will continue work with Stanford's researchers on conductive coatings to combat charging noise."

Specifically, Aim 1 will develop a one dimensional discontinuous Galerkin method to solve the Teukolsky equations. This method tracks the particle and keeps it at the domain interfaces while computing the derivatives of the Dirac delta functions as matching conditions at the boundary of the domain. This approach simulates the in-spiral phase to extremely high accuracy. However, for an accurate simulation of the plunge and ring-down phase we require a shock capturing scheme that can handle derivatives of the Dirac delta function and provide highly efficient and accurate multi-dimensional numerical results. For this, Aim 2 will develop a very high order WENO solver that will include the ability to handle up to third derivatives of the Dirac delta function and be made highly efficient in the regions away from the discontinuity. Finally, efficient and accurate time evolution approaches must be tailored to the spatial schemes in Aims 1 and 2. For this, Aim 3 will develop stable and efficient time-discretizations tailored for the spatial schemes in Aims 1 and 2. For each spatial discretization, time-discretization approaches such as Runge-Kutta and multi-step Runge-Kutta methods will be tailored such that the methods are low storage, computationally efficient, have small dispersion errors, small error constants, and stability regions that are tailored to the spatial discretization, and (for WENO) optimal SSP time-steps. The proposed developments in both spatial and temporal discretizations will lead to more efficient methods that can accurately and efficiently handle long time-integration and the presence of Dirac delta functions and its derivatives. Furthermore, the development of an accurate, efficient numerical solver capable of generating waveforms over sizable portions of the parameter space is a major advance in the computation of gravitational waves, and will thus have a major impact on the field of gravitational wave science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Merging black holes and neutron stars are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO), and black hole-neutron star mergers are one possible source of short, hard gamma-ray bursts.  This research program uses supercomputers to numerically solve Einstein's equations of general relativity for i) merging black holes, especially cases (such as mergers with black holes that are spinning nearly as rapidly as possible) that have not been previously explored, and ii) a black hole, spinning nearly as rapidly as possible, that merges with a neutron star, tearing the star apart.<br/><br/>Almost a century after Einstein first predicted their existence, gravitational waves---ripples of spacetime curvature---are poised to open a new window on the universe. Advanced LIGO, an NSF-supported project, is nearing completion and will soon begin searching for gravitational waves from black holes, neutron stars, and other sources, such as supernovae. By predicting the gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and neutron stars, this research program will increase the reach of Advanced LIGO and will help us to learn as much as possible about LIGO's astronomical sources. Through their participation in this program, students at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate- and Hispanic-serving institution, will learn transferable research and computational skills while playing important roles in preparing for the first direct detections of gravitational waves, an imminent discovery that could dramatically alter our understanding of the universe."

A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations. One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes. These processes are primary targets for gravitational wave detectors now being deployed, like LIGO, and there is an urgent need for reliable waveforms. The investigators will use a computational technique, pseudospectral collocation, that delivers high accuracy with a much smaller computational cost than other techniques.<br/>Other applications will include benchmarking of analytical approximations, such as the post-Newtonian and Effective One Body techniques; computations in difficult regimes of parameter space such as high spins and mass ratios; and analytical explorations of the numerical spacetimes to improve our understanding of strong field gravity. A second focus of the research is to study the coalescence and merger of binary systems containing a neutron star and a black hole, or two neutron stars. These are also prime scientific targets for LIGO. The investigators will include ever more realistic descriptions of the microphysics in the simulations, such as the equation of state of nuclear matter, neutrino effects,and magnetic fields.<br/><br/>This research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental physics. There are currently no real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes. For experiments like LIGO to confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the black holes that LIGO may observe the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? The research will have an impact on astronomy.  Mergers of compact binaries containing neutron stars may lead to the emission of electromagnetic and neutrino signals, opening the possibility of concurrently observing such events in multiple ways leading to greater understanding of such events.  Simulations carried out by this project will help determine what signals to look for and how to interpret them when they are detected. The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand."

To date the only sources that have been detected are merging black holes.   However, there are many other possible sources for gravitational waves, some known and others unknown.  The search for these sources, and how they contribute to the structure of the cosmos, lies at the heart of this new discipline.   Their detection through LIGO relies on the development of data analysis tools that allow the extraction of the gravitational wave signal from the interferometer background.  The analysis of LIGO data is of such complexity that new techniques are currently being developed to cover the large parameter space spanned by potential sources. This award supports research on how to accelerate data analysis pipelines through application of new numerical methods that employ techniques previously developed by the group from general mathematical principles.<br/><br/>This award supports a systematic approach for deriving closed form approximations of waveforms emitted by binary black hole collisions. These closed form expressions will not sacrifice fidelity or modeling accuracy, will not perform phenomenological fits, but instead will find closed form expressions from ab-initio simulations of the full Einstein equations. Though the approach will be generic, during this project only the case of two non-spinning black holes will be considered. The goal of this project is to provide the LIGO project with a very fast way of evaluating gravitational waveforms for data analysis. This project will be a continuation of the group's research on surrogate and reduced order modeling and sparse representations, with applications to gravitational waves. It will add the additional thrust of symbolic regression through genetic programming. The goal is to design a systematic framework for deriving closed form expressions for gravitational waves from different types of sources. The scope will be limited in this project to demonstrating a proof of concept using existing surrogate reduced basis models for non-spinning black hole collisions."

This watershed event has ushered in a new era of gravitational wave astronomy, which will transform our understanding of the Universe by providing information through a previously inaccessible channel. LIGO operates at the very edge of the sensitivity required to detect gravitational waves, and therefore, non-stationary noise caused by the environment, e.g., weather and man-made noise, limits LIGO's sensitivity to short-duration gravitational wave transient signals such as the one detected in September. In order to ensure the most opportunity for the advancement of science, this project aims to mine the extensive auxiliary information available in the LIGO observatories in realtime in order to mitigate the impact of non-stationary noise and increase the rate of transient gravitational wave detections. Doing so will afford increased opportunities for joint gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations, which are thought to be rare.<br/><br/>This project aims to address a key piece of missing software infrastructure to use machine learning and inference techniques to utilize auxiliary information such as seismometers, microphones and various control loop signals, to identify non-stationary noise that couples to the gravitational-wave channel in near realtime. The software will be broken into three components: a signal decomposer, a signal classifier and a signal trainer. The signal classifier will determine, given the decomposed, instantaneous output of auxiliary channels and the training data, the probability that non-stationary noise is present. These software components will be built from reusable resources that can be applied across the time-domain gravitational wave community in data calibration, data transfer, and analysis.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Physics Division in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences."

What is the engine powering short-hard gamma-ray bursts? What is the maximum neutron star mass and what does it imply for matter at extreme densities? How fast do black holes spin? Can we distinguish between different astrophysical environments that form binary compact objects (black holes or neutron stars)?

The work focuses on developing a concrete framework for the processing of detections of binary compact object mergers by Advanced LIGO. The goals are to extract the maximal available astrophysical information for binaries with compact objects with any mass and spin configuration. <br/><br/>Specifically the following two main research projects are targeted: (i) physical parameter estimation for compact-object coalescence events using advanced sampling methods, targeting the acceleration of parameter estimation simulations and results, using waveforms of maximal physical realism including numerical-relativity waveforms, accounting for non-Gaussian noise, and for improvements from electromagnetic counterpart detections; (ii) the calculation of astrophysical models of binary compact objects detected by Advanced LIGO and the use of LIGO observations to constrain such models.

The GW170817 event has inspired a new GW search strategy using simultaneous all-sky optical imaging measurements to provide improved detection confidence as well as source identification/localization. This grant will fund the development and testing of this improved GW search in Advanced LIGO/Virgo (aLIGO/Virgo) operation run 3 (O3), with the potential to substantially increase the number of confirmed GW detections. This will significantly improve the progress of science in the national interest by leveraging the existing investments in gravitational wave and optical observatories to provide an estimated ~25% enhancement in the number of detected systems during O3, and pave the way for future multi-messenger investigations that could potentially quadruple the number of detected sources. The proposed research is at the intersection of the multi-messenger astrophysics, general relativity, digital signal processing and computing, which require young researchers to develop a deep knowledge of modern astrophysical theories, and understanding of gravitational wave instrumentation, and gives them opportunity to get firsthand experience with sophisticated signal/image-processing algorithms, computational methods, manipulation of large data sets and high performance computing.<br/><br/>The novel GW search proposed here is based on combining aLIGO/Virgo sub-threshold triggers with simultaneous optical imaging using the Evryscope technique.  Evryscope images the entire observable night-time sky simultaneously with 2-minute cadence.  Scientists can then select only those optical transient events in the aLIGO/Virgo error region which appear within the same 2-minute window as the GW candidate - reducing the GW-only false alarm probability by factors larger than 20,000. for any night-time GW events. This enables improved detection confidence for marginal GW events and thus enhanced GW detection volume.  GW1708187's optical counterpart could be detected by the current Evryscope out to D ~260 Mpc, and future Evryscope-style systems to distances further than 350 Mpc. Analyses show that a future network of Evryscope-style detectors would enhance the number of GW events detected by a factor of ~2-4 compared to GW-only observations. Such a future network would particularly benefit GW source population studies and cosmological applications of GW events. This approach will also provide coverage of the brightest portion of the optical lightcurve, and arcsecond-level localization for all of these events, which will dramatically improve the EM followup response from the community as a whole, leading to improved astrophysical context for interpreting the implications of the GW event. The proposed work here is to carry out a sub-threshold GW search in aLIGO/Virgo O3, using the Evryscope North and South facilities for simultaneous optical coverage. Based on the properties of GW170817's GW properties, optical counterpart, and analyses presented here, such a search could add an additional ~25% more detections to the number of confirmed BNS mergers in O3.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project brings together a team of applied and computational mathematicians with expertise in constructing error estimates for solutions of partial differential equations and physicists with expertise in numerical solutions of the Einstein equation and gravitational wave data analysis.  The primary technical goal is to develop and analyze new mathematical and computational methods that can be used by the gravitational physics community to compute rigorous and reliably accurate estimates for the errors of numerical solutions of the Einstein equations and the gravitational waveforms that are determined from them.  In particular, this research explores the following issues:<br/>(1) Error quantification and a posteriori analysis using adjoint sensitivity techniques, and their associated numerical implementation;<br/>(2) Adaptive algorithms that are driven by goal-oriented error control, and their associated theoretical convergence analysis; and<br/>(3) The role of covariance symmetry and associated geometric structures in error analysis and the construction of numerical methods.<br/>As part of the a posteriori analysis, the project team will develop the basic theory of adjoint operators and duality for the Einstein equations. This will provide the foundation for future investigations into sensitivity analysis, data assimilation and uncertainty quantification for using LIGO data. It should be emphasized that the main thrusts of the proposed research are discretization-neutral, and therefore have broad applicability to the breadth of numerical relativity codes in existence.<br/><br/>The NSF-supported Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) can be successful only if highly accurate gravitational waveform models are available for use as part of the data analysis process, both for detecting gravitational waves and also for measuring the physical properties of any detected signals.  The strongest sources of gravitational waves are expected to be collisions between heavy, dense stars or black holes, which can only be modeled accurately using complex numerical simulations to calculate the anticipated gravitational waveforms.  Such waveforms are needed to construct the filters that allow detection of the weak gravitational-wave signals in the noisy detector, and such waveforms are also needed to measure the physical properties of the sources of any detected signals.  The waveform accuracy needed to accomplish the required data analysis tasks is quite high.  However, the numerical relativity community has yet to develop the analytic and computational tools needed to evaluate rigorously the accuracy of the numerical waveform models.  If the qualitative accuracy measures currently used by the numerical relativity community are too optimistic, the rigorous new methods developed by this project could make the difference between success and failure of LIGO.  If the current numerical waveforms are in fact accurate enough, the methods developed by this project could improve the computational efficiency of determining waveforms with a specified accuracy level, and thus reduce the cost of producing them."

Such changes occur when the instrument is in a transient state (such as when it is being turned on, aligned, or reset after environmental perturbations disturb it).

By improving the characterization of the detector in its out-of-lock state, the time necessary to return it to the operational state can be reduced improving the duty cycle of the instrument, and hence its ability to observe astrophysically significant events.

Research with GreenPrairie will focus on some of the most extreme phenomena in the universe, where the strongest gravitational and magnetic fields interact with ultra-relativistic matter and high-energy radiation, that can only be studied through advanced, large-scale computation and visualization. The cluster will be used for timely simulations of key astrophysical sources for advanced LIGO, which uses information from theoretical waveforms to interpret the observed signals and determine the nature of the astrophysical sources. Specifically, the cluster will be used to simulate black-hole binaries, and their merger waveforms, across the entire space of parameters relevant to advanced LIGO and next generation detectors, as well as fast response simulations triggered by gravitational wave detections. The cluster will also be used to study accretion problems involving close and/or merging binary black hole systems which are expected to be observable in the electromagnetic spectrum by current and future astronomical surveys, such as LSST.

The project brings together a team of applied and computational mathematicians with expertise in constructing error estimates for solutions of partial differential equations and physicists with expertise in numerical solutions of the Einstein equation and gravitational wave data analysis.  The primary technical goal is to develop and analyze new mathematical and computational methods that can be used by the gravitational physics community to compute rigorous and reliably accurate estimates for the errors of numerical solutions of the Einstein equations and the gravitational waveforms that are determined from them.  In particular, this research explores the following issues:<br/>(1) Error quantification and a posteriori analysis using adjoint sensitivity techniques, and their associated numerical implementation;<br/>(2) Adaptive algorithms that are driven by goal-oriented error control, and their associated theoretical convergence analysis; and<br/>(3) The role of covariance symmetry and associated geometric structures in error analysis and the construction of numerical methods.<br/>As part of the a posteriori analysis, the project team will develop the basic theory of adjoint operators and duality for the Einstein equations. This will provide the foundation for future investigations into sensitivity analysis, data assimilation and uncertainty quantification for using LIGO data. It should be emphasized that the main thrusts of the proposed research are discretization-neutral, and therefore have broad applicability to the breadth of numerical relativity codes in existence.<br/><br/>The NSF-supported Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) can be successful only if highly accurate gravitational waveform models are available for use as part of the data analysis process, both for detecting gravitational waves and also for measuring the physical properties of any detected signals.  The strongest sources of gravitational waves are expected to be collisions between heavy, dense stars or black holes, which can only be modeled accurately using complex numerical simulations to calculate the anticipated gravitational waveforms.  Such waveforms are needed to construct the filters that allow detection of the weak gravitational-wave signals in the noisy detector, and such waveforms are also needed to measure the physical properties of the sources of any detected signals.  The waveform accuracy needed to accomplish the required data analysis tasks is quite high.  However, the numerical relativity community has yet to develop the analytic and computational tools needed to evaluate rigorously the accuracy of the numerical waveform models.  If the qualitative accuracy measures currently used by the numerical relativity community are too optimistic, the rigorous new methods developed by this project could make the difference between success and failure of LIGO.  If the current numerical waveforms are in fact accurate enough, the methods developed by this project could improve the computational efficiency of determining waveforms with a specified accuracy level, and thus reduce the cost of producing them."

On 14th September 2015, the (second-generation) detectors of the LIGO project made the first direct GW detection. This was a ground-breaking event for fundamental physics, observing for the first time a binary black hole system merging to form a single black hole, and has opened a new window into the universe allowing us to 'listen' to its gravitational signatures. The project supported by this award will enable sensitivities envisioned for the next generation GW detectors and new discoveries in gravitational astronomy, as well as an improvement of the detection rates for black hole and neutron star mergers. Gravitational waves cause changes in the separation of LIGO's mirrors so small that the thermal vibration of the mirrors and their coatings, so called Brownian thermal noise, will limit the sensitivity of current and future detectors. This project will develop new materials with low thermal noise to be used in future LIGO upgrades. This work is a collaborative effort between Martin Fejer's group at Stanford University and Jessica Steinlechner's group at Hamburg University, with this award supporting the US contribution to the collaboration. Progress in this area will benefit a broader applied research community, since there are applications beyond LIGO for low thermal noise coatings: atomic clocks, quantum information systems, precision interferometry all demand low-loss coatings. The nature of this multidisciplinary effort makes it ideal for training graduate students.<br/><br/>Thermal noise in highly-reflective mirror coatings is directly proportional to the coating thickness, the mechanical loss of the materials and the mirror temperature. To significantly reduce coating thermal noise, future GW detectors will be cryogenically operated. The aim of this project is the development of highly-reflective multilayer coatings for future GW detectors, based on studies of coating properties, composition and structure, to meet the challenging requirements on absorption, reflectivity and mechanical loss. While this project mainly targets future cryogenic detectors, thermal noise reduction for detector upgrades operating at room temperature detectors is also part of the proposed research. A key part of this effort is optimizing coating materials which have demonstrated lower levels of mechanical loss, such as amorphous silicon and silicon nitride; and investigate the use of nano-layers, proven to suppress crystallization enabling higher heat treatment temperatures, which can lead to lower optical and mechanical losses. Hamburg will have a unique ability to deposit coatings using a pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system with heated substrates and variable laser pulse durations. Stanford has had a leading role within the LSC in developing experimental methods to characterize the optical and structural properties of the amorphous coating materials. This work will be underpinned by studies of coating properties to understand links between deposition parameters, coating structure, loss and absorption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reliable measurements about these previously-unseen events will allow astrophysicists to infer the processes responsible for forming them, and to test general relativity. The main thrust of this project is to perform comparisons of the best available solutions of Einstein's theory (large-scale supercomputer simulations) and current approximations used to estimate the parameters of the binary systems, such as masses, spins, orbital eccentricity, etc. Numerical relativity solutions will be used to remove bias and reduce systematic errors in the estimation of these parameters from data observed by LIGO. Accurate knowledge of these parameters will lead to a greater understanding of the processes that formed these binary systems and the history of their corresponding stellar progenitors. <br/><br/>The major theme of this project is the interpretation of gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, as measured using LIGO data.  The PI's group will help produce these distributions and the associated science. The principal method at present to infer the properties of coalescing black holes relies on approximate solutions of Einstein's equations, whose limitations will bias astrophysical inferences about individual events and populations. Thus, to enable this core activity, this group will directly and indirectly compare LIGO data to numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole coalescence and will perform inference using several models in parallel, including multimodal surrogate models tuned to numerical relativity, to draw the sharpest possible conclusions and assess the systematic error.  Additionally, the group will extend underlying parameter estimation strategy used in this approach.  For example, by using Gaussian process interpolation of the likelihood function to make the inferences more robust and to assess their error. They will also develop a hierarchical strategy for targeting numerical relativity followup simulations and incorporating them into the parameter and systematic error estimates. These techniques will be apply to perform tests of general relativity using multiple modes excited during the merger, particularly as excited coherently during the coalescence of precessing binary black holes."

While these detections have already validated the theory of general relativity at new levels, enabled novel cosmological measurements, and greatly advanced our understanding of compact objects, they have only scratched the surface of what these detectors can achieve.  LIGO and Virgo's next observing campaigns will bring hundreds more observations of compact binary mergers. The goal of this work is to use those detections to answer the questions: 1) How are compact binaries formed? and 2) Are we missing unmodeled physics?  The group conducting this work will include a teacher from a local high school for two consecutive summers, enabling the integration of topics in gravitational wave astronomy into the curriculum.  <br/><br/>Over the next 2-3 years, LIGO's improved sensitivity will increase detection rates from one per month to one per day.

Alternative signal models will also be developed, which will be sensitive to a range of unmodeled physics (e.g., tidal disruptions of neutron stars, excitation of neutron star resonances, deviations from relativity), that current characterization techniques could miss.  To enable this science an improved analysis infrastructure is necessary, capable of handling much higher event rates.

Direct detection of gravitational waves is a breakthrough research area in astrophysics and fundamental physics, thanks to long-term technology development which led to the successful detection of gravitational waves by NSF's Advanced LIGO observatories beginning in 2015.  However, the Advanced LIGO detectors are only sensitive at frequencies above about 20 Hz, while the LISA space detector, to be launched in the 2030s, will only cover frequencies below 0.1 Hz.  SOGRO is a design for a new mid-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) detector to explore the frequency range in between LIGO and LISA.  SOGRO employs magnetically levitated test masses and utilizes the exotic properties of superconductors and enhanced stability of materials at cryogenic temperatures.  Unlike LIGO, SOGRO would be equally sensitive to GWs coming from anywhere in the sky, and would be capable of resolving the source direction and wave polarization. The goal of the present research project is to demonstrate key technologies of SOGRO by modifying an existing superconducting gravity gradiometer (SGG).  The work will test the technical soundness of the detector concept and help identify areas that will require further studies to establish the feasibility of SOGRO while training the next generation of scientists in precision superconducting measurement techniques.  In addition to GW science, an improved SGG can benefit geophysics, especially the newly emerging field of gravity-aided earthquake early warning.  By detecting transient gravity signals arising from ground rupture in the early stages of earthquakes, which travel at the speed of light, SGGs could reduce the size of the 'blind zone' of early warning systems and increase their lead times, which should reduce losses due to earthquake shaking.<br/><br/>By combining the motions of six symmetrically distributed test masses at equidistant points on a sphere, the SOGRO detector design has the full-tensor characteristics of a spherical GW antenna.  A three-axis diagonal-component SGG with a 19-cm baseline and mechanically suspended test masses (TMs) reached a strain sensitivity level of 5 x 10^(-13) Hz^(-1/2) at 1 Hz by the early 1990s, which is three orders of magnitude more sensitive than demonstrated to date by other gradiometers, including atom interferometers and torsion bars.  SOGRO is a greatly enlarged version of the tensor SGG with a 50-m baseline.  To reach its target sensitivity for GW signals, SOGRO must meet several demanding technical requirements.  Two of them are: (1) the levitated superconducting TMs must have differential-mode frequency as low as 0.01 Hz and quality factor as high as 10^8 at the temperature of 0.1 K, and (2) the platform must be suspended in such a way to isolate the detector from the ground angular motion to one part in a million.  The objective of the present research project is to modify an existing SGG with magnetically-suspended TMs and a 13.5-cm baseline (that was constructed for a NASA-funded project) and demonstrate (1) a differential mode frequency as low as 0.3 Hz with Q as high as 3x10^5 at T = 4.2 K, and (2) isolation of the ground angular motion by a factor of 10^3 by suspending the platform as a pendulum.  Successful demonstration of these features would advance two key technologies of SOGRO to within two to three orders of magnitude from the levels required for a full-scale SOGRO GW detector.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GW170817 event has inspired a new GW search strategy using simultaneous all-sky optical imaging measurements to provide improved detection confidence as well as source identification/localization. This grant will fund the development and testing of this improved GW search in Advanced LIGO/Virgo (aLIGO/Virgo) operation run 3 (O3), with the potential to substantially increase the number of confirmed GW detections. This will significantly improve the progress of science in the national interest by leveraging the existing investments in gravitational wave and optical observatories to provide an estimated ~25% enhancement in the number of detected systems during O3, and pave the way for future multi-messenger investigations that could potentially quadruple the number of detected sources. The proposed research is at the intersection of the multi-messenger astrophysics, general relativity, digital signal processing and computing, which require young researchers to develop a deep knowledge of modern astrophysical theories, and understanding of gravitational wave instrumentation, and gives them opportunity to get firsthand experience with sophisticated signal/image-processing algorithms, computational methods, manipulation of large data sets and high performance computing.<br/><br/>The novel GW search proposed here is based on combining aLIGO/Virgo sub-threshold triggers with simultaneous optical imaging using the Evryscope technique.  Evryscope images the entire observable night-time sky simultaneously with 2-minute cadence.  Scientists can then select only those optical transient events in the aLIGO/Virgo error region which appear within the same 2-minute window as the GW candidate - reducing the GW-only false alarm probability by factors larger than 20,000. for any night-time GW events. This enables improved detection confidence for marginal GW events and thus enhanced GW detection volume.  GW1708187's optical counterpart could be detected by the current Evryscope out to D ~260 Mpc, and future Evryscope-style systems to distances further than 350 Mpc. Analyses show that a future network of Evryscope-style detectors would enhance the number of GW events detected by a factor of ~2-4 compared to GW-only observations. Such a future network would particularly benefit GW source population studies and cosmological applications of GW events. This approach will also provide coverage of the brightest portion of the optical lightcurve, and arcsecond-level localization for all of these events, which will dramatically improve the EM followup response from the community as a whole, leading to improved astrophysical context for interpreting the implications of the GW event. The proposed work here is to carry out a sub-threshold GW search in aLIGO/Virgo O3, using the Evryscope North and South facilities for simultaneous optical coverage. Based on the properties of GW170817's GW properties, optical counterpart, and analyses presented here, such a search could add an additional ~25% more detections to the number of confirmed BNS mergers in O3.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both the data analysis and theory work under this award will help transform LIGO from a prototype instrument into a tool for exploring physics and astrophysics, including the possibility of exotic particle phases and the complicated microphysics of matter under the most extreme conditions.  A continuous wave signal in particular will give a direct view into the otherwise inaccessible interiors of neutron stars.

The discovery of gravitational waves as well as the discovery of these sources with Advanced LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory built by the National Science Foundation to make a direct detection of gravitational waves, would be a major milestone in the history of science. Advanced LIGO encompasses an extremely diverse array of underlying scientific and engineering disciplines: examples include lasers, optics, low noise electronics, control systems, grid computing, algorithm development, and handling large data sets. <br/><br/>The Advanced LIGO interferometers have turned on and commissioning of them has increased their sensitivity far above previous detectors. The goal of a tenfold sensitivity improvement is in sight. Because the search volume scales as distance cubed, advanced LIGO will have more than 1000 times more sources within its reach. To achieve this improved sensitivity, essentially everything except for the vacuum system has been replaced. This includes the use of a 180 Watt laser, quadruple pendulum suspensions, 40 kilogram test masses, active seismic platforms, a signal-recycled interferometer, stable recycling cavities, an output mode cleaner, DC readout, and improved thermal compensation. The higher laser power presents challenges for the input optics, a responsibility of the University of Florida. Moreover, this research has impacts that go beyond gravitational wave science. High-power optical devices developed in this project have commercial applications in the laser and optics industries.<br/><br/>This project will address items that could be needed in order to optimize the performance of the detector. It also addresses basic research needed for future upgrades and next generation detectors, which will further increase the science reach of the observatories as well as work on detector characterization.

A novel scheme for sensing alignment errors will be modeled and prototyped. Thermal coating noise as a function of temperature will be measured.

This quantum noise limit (QNL) is reached due to extremely high circulating laser power, in addition to mitigation of other classical noise sources. Studying quantum noise limits and finding ways to circumvent them is important not only for improved performance of future GW detectors, but also allows for the study of fundamental quantum effects, such as squeezing and entanglement, in macroscopic mechanical systems.<br/><br/>This award supports an experimental research program to generate and characterize quantum states arising from the interaction of light with macroscopic mechanical systems, with the goal to better understand the fundamental limits of quantum measurement, as well as to improve the performance of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. The centerpiece of the research program is a meter-scale interferometer with low-mass suspended mirrors, high circulating power, and a quantum-limited readout. Experiments will be conducted to study the following radiation pressure induced phenomena, using variants of this single apparatus: (1) Observation of ponderomotive squeezing, a novel alternative to the more traditional use of nonlinear optical media, that relies on the fundamental quantum mechanics of the shot noise and radiation-pressure noise correlations in an optomechanical oscillator system. This is one of the hallmarks of quantum effects in quantum-noise-dominated gravitational-wave interferometers, such as the Advanced LIGO detectors, and warrants studying in prototype interferometers. (2) Observation of ground state cooling of a macroscopic object is possible because radiation pressure can be used to reduce the motion of objects without introducing thermal noise---a much sought after goal in the realm of quantum measurement. (3) Observation of quantum entanglement, arising from radiation pressure induced coupling of the motion of the mirror and the quantum radiation field. (4) Direct observation quantum radiation pressure noise. Advanced LIGO is expected to be limited by quantum radiation pressure noise in the lowest part of its detection band, and studying the interaction of this noise source with the optomechanical system is likely to reveal deeper understanding, or even new physics. None of these phenomena have been observed experimentally to date. <br/><br/>The main purpose of this research program is to gain further understanding of radiation-pressure dominated interferometers, an important feature of next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Equally attractive is the prospect of exploring the fundamental physics of quantum correlations due to optical-mechanical couplings in a macroscopic mechanical oscillator system. The broader impact of the proposed work lies in its scientific and its personnel diversity. The scientific diversity arises from the necessarily cross-disciplinary nature of the proposed research: it combines the techniques and formalism of quantum optics and quantum measurement theory with gravitational-wave detection. The personnel diversity is the outcome of aggressive recruitment of women and minority students by the PI (herself a member of minority groups), through her own efforts as well as those of the outreach programs of the LIGO Laboratory and MIT. In addition, the sub-QNL measurements are popular with students and generate considerable enthusiasm with the public as well. The proposed experiments share common technologies with quantum teleportation, quantum information, quantum control and condensed matter physics (nano- and micro-mechanical oscillators)."

The project brings together a team of applied and computational mathematicians with expertise in constructing error estimates for solutions of partial differential equations and physicists with expertise in numerical solutions of the Einstein equation and gravitational wave data analysis.  The primary technical goal is to develop and analyze new mathematical and computational methods that can be used by the gravitational physics community to compute rigorous and reliably accurate estimates for the errors of numerical solutions of the Einstein equations and the gravitational waveforms that are determined from them.  In particular, this research explores the following issues:<br/>(1) Error quantification and a posteriori analysis using adjoint sensitivity techniques, and their associated numerical implementation;<br/>(2) Adaptive algorithms that are driven by goal-oriented error control, and their associated theoretical convergence analysis; and<br/>(3) The role of covariance symmetry and associated geometric structures in error analysis and the construction of numerical methods.<br/>As part of the a posteriori analysis, the project team will develop the basic theory of adjoint operators and duality for the Einstein equations. This will provide the foundation for future investigations into sensitivity analysis, data assimilation and uncertainty quantification for using LIGO data. It should be emphasized that the main thrusts of the proposed research are discretization-neutral, and therefore have broad applicability to the breadth of numerical relativity codes in existence.<br/><br/>The NSF-supported Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory (LIGO) can be successful only if highly accurate gravitational waveform models are available for use as part of the data analysis process, both for detecting gravitational waves and also for measuring the physical properties of any detected signals.  The strongest sources of gravitational waves are expected to be collisions between heavy, dense stars or black holes, which can only be modeled accurately using complex numerical simulations to calculate the anticipated gravitational waveforms.  Such waveforms are needed to construct the filters that allow detection of the weak gravitational-wave signals in the noisy detector, and such waveforms are also needed to measure the physical properties of the sources of any detected signals.  The waveform accuracy needed to accomplish the required data analysis tasks is quite high.  However, the numerical relativity community has yet to develop the analytic and computational tools needed to evaluate rigorously the accuracy of the numerical waveform models.  If the qualitative accuracy measures currently used by the numerical relativity community are too optimistic, the rigorous new methods developed by this project could make the difference between success and failure of LIGO.  If the current numerical waveforms are in fact accurate enough, the methods developed by this project could improve the computational efficiency of determining waveforms with a specified accuracy level, and thus reduce the cost of producing them."

These two telescopes provide astronomers in the U.S., Canada, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile with access to the whole sky. Using modern instruments on each telescope, astronomers are able to study everything from asteroids, comets and nearby planets, to huge super-bright stars and distant galaxies.  Plans are now under way at Gemini to prepare each telescope for a new decade of discovery. Astrophysics in the 2020s will be revolutionized by ""Multi-Messenger Astronomy"", an exciting new field that uses gravitational waves and high-energy particles, as well as ordinary everyday light, to study some of the most exotic objects and explosive events in the Universe. Facilities like NSF's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), the NSF/University of Wisconsin IceCube South Pole Neutrino Observatory, and NSF's latest telescope, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will detect these ""messengers"", changing the way we study the Universe. In support of these remarkable new observatories, Gemini will develop new computer software and new optics hardware so that astronomers can study each new discovery quickly and in high detail. In addition to making remarkable discoveries and doing amazing science, Gemini is also a leader in education, public information and outreach activities. Gemini staff bring science to the communities in both Hawai'i and Chile through unique programs such as Journey through the Universe, AstroDay, and Viaje al Universo. With this new award they will extend their reach by developing a Planetarium show that will help the public better understand Multi-Messenger Astronomy. Gemini will also run workshops for educators and communicators so that they too can explain the exciting new discoveries that will surely be made by LIGO, IceCube, LSST and Gemini over the coming decade. <br/><br/>Gemini has proposed a challenging though very exciting program of cutting-edge development activities that are in line with NSF's strategic goals and those of its international partners in the Gemini Observatory. The enhancement of existing Adaptive Optics (AO) capabilities at Gemini-S and particularly Gemini-N on Maunakea, one of the best sites in the world for high-resolution imaging, will ensure that the observatory remains competitive in the 2020s, in the run-up to the commissioning of 30-to-40 meter class telescopes at the end of the coming decade.  Wide-field AO-corrected infrared imaging at Gemini will complement a similar capability on the James Webb Space Telescope, which will hopefully be executing its prime mission in the 2020s. At the same time, in collaboration with other national facilities, Gemini staff will develop and mature software aimed specifically at preparing Gemini for time domain and multi-messenger astronomy in a decade when LIGO and LSST will drive many of the most exciting science discoveries. The proposal's goal of ensuring that Gemini is the best positioned public 8-meter class facility for follow-up activities is clearly consistent with the wishes of the observing communities at home and abroad.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

After 100 years of development since Einstein first predicted their existence, gravitational waves are now regularly discovered by the LIGO and Virgo observatories. These waves, carried by the changing curvature of space-time, inform us of violent collisions of black holes and ultracompact dead stars, called neutron stars, in the distant cosmos. Studying these distant collisions enables us to probe the fundamental laws of physics, the evolution of the universe, and the origin of our Galaxy or even our Solar System. This research will address a fundamental aspect of cosmic collisions: their ability to accelerate particles to extremely high energies, about a billion times higher than what has been achieved on Earth. The work will search for the neutrino signature of extreme acceleration from collisions detected by gravitational waves. In particular it will elucidate the currently unknown mechanisms by which black holes can eject energetic particles while swallowing matter from the debris of the collision. Additionally, the observation of multiple cosmic messengers from colliding black holes and neutron stars will be developed and used as an education tool to train students in physics and beyond.<br/><br/>The major theme of the project is the multi-messenger observation of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos from compact binary mergers and core-collapse supernovae. Data will be analyzed from the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave observatories and the IceCube neutrino observatory. The main goal of the work is to find and understand multi-messenger sources that are electromagnetically dark due to dense gas, stellar envelope, or ejecta between the source and the observer. The work will investigate a state-of-the-art search technique to help LIGO achieve its full potential by bringing closer the detection of the last missing puzzle piece from multi-messenger astrophysics: the joint observation of gravitational waves and neutrinos.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the Universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for the goal of direct detection of gravitational waves, as the second generation of gravitational-wave detectors is commissioned at the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO).  The sensitivity of the new aLIGO detectors will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before.  The aLIGO data will be used to search for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological gravitational wave sources.  This specific award will support research that searches the aLIGO data to look for the background signals that arise from gravitational-wave signals from many independent sources. <br/><br/>The first observation data from aLIGO is expected in 2015, with the sensitivity and duty-cycle of the detectors steadily increasing over the following three years.  This project focuses on the searches for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), which arises from an incoherent superposition of gravitational-wave signals generated by many independent sources. The SGWB could be of cosmological origin: for example, in inflationary models the SGWB is generated just moments after the Big Bang, implying that the SGWB may contain unique information about the first moments in the evolution of the universe and about the physics of energy scales not accessible in laboratories. Similarly, the SGWB could be of astrophysical origin: for example, summing up contributions from all magnetars or from coalescences of all binary neutron stars and/or black holes in the universe leads to a stochastic gravitational-wave ""foreground"" that contains information about these most violent objects and events in the universe. <br/> <br/>The SGWB searches with aLIGO data will be conducted using cross-correlation techniques that were developed and successfully used in the SGWB searches with initial LIGO data. The searches for isotropic SGWB are expected to result in a measurement about 1000x more sensitive than the current best upper limits. Similarly, the searches for anisotropic SGWB will result in about 100x more sensitive measurement than the current best upper limits. Such substantial advances will result in a series of interesting cosmological and astrophysical implications, including detection or new constraints on parity violation in the early universe, evolution of the universe during the first minute after the Big Bang, equation of state in neutron stars, rate of compact binary coalescences and its evolution with redshift."

The construction and upgrade of the facilities used to enable scientific discovery in these disparate fields of research have led to a common pair of computational grand challenges: (i) datasets with ever-increasing complexity and volume; and (ii) data mining analyses that must be performed in real-time with oversubscribed computational resources. Furthermore, the convergence of gravitational wave astrophysics with electromagnetic and astroparticle surveys, the very birth of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, has already provided a glimpse of the transformational discoveries that it will enable in years to come. Given the unique potential for scientific discovery with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the combination of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, the community needs to accelerate the development and exploitation of deep learning algorithms that will outperform existing approaches. This project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science. It will push the frontiers of deep learning at scale, demonstrating the versatility and scalability of these methods to accelerate and enable new physics in the big data era. Because these methods are also applicable to many other parts of our national and global economy and society, this work will positively impact many fields. The students and junior scientists to be mentored and trained in this research will interact closely with our industry partners, creating new career opportunities, and strengthening synergies between academia and industry.

This work combines scalable deep learning algorithms, trained with TB-size datasets within minutes using thousands of GPUs/CPUs, with state-of-the-art approaches to endow the predictions of deterministic deep learning models with complete posterior distributions. The team will also investigate the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate low-latency inference of machine learning algorithms to minimize the demands of future computing, which is a central goal for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and particle physics. The open source tools to be developed as part of these activities will be readily shared with and adopted by LIGO, LHC, and LSST as core data analytics algorithms that will significantly increase the speed and depth of existing algorithms, enabling new physics while requiring minimal computational resources for real-time inferences analyses. The team will organize deep learning workshops and bootcamps to train students and researchers on how to use and contribute to our framework, creating a wide network of contributors and developers across key science missions.

The main focus is on the development and application of novel tools for numerical relativity and perturbative methods to assist the current and future gravitational wave detection efforts and to solve problems of current astrophysical interest.  Recent breakthroughs have allowed numerical relativity to enter a new golden age of applications to astrophysics and gravitational wave data analysis.  In particular, the numerical relativity group at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) (and independently the NASA Goddard group) has developed a new technique, known as the ""moving-puncture"" approach, capable of stably evolving black-hole binaries from the inspiral phase (for at least several orbits) through the merger and ring-down phases.  The main scientific objectives of the numerical relativity research program are to investigate: (i) some important open questions of physical interest about the details of highly nonlinear interactions, (ii) the generation of gravitational radiation, and (iii) astrophysical properties of unequal-mass, spinning black-hole binaries.  To achieve these, this research will address some important challenges such as: (1) obtaining astrophysically relevant initial data for simulations that start from a realistic inspiral orbit, (2) exploring the large parameter space for different mass ratios and spins, and (3) ensuring that the multiple-orbit simulations themselves are accurate enough for both gravitational wave detection and the interpretation of the signals. On the computational side, the investigators propose to enhance their current computational framework (LazEv) to properly address these challenges. In addition, the ""Lazarus"" program to extract the gravitational radiation from late-time full-3D binary evolutions and evolve it with a stable and accurate 2D perturbative evolution will be extended in the framework of the moving punctures approach.  Finally, an ongoing program will be extended to study the orbital decay of a small compact object orbiting a Kerr black hole.<br/>Once detected, gravitational waves will open a new window into the universe.  The coalescence of unequal-mass black-hole binaries with randomly oriented individual spins will be one of the strongest astrophysical sources of gravitational waves detectable by both ground-based detectors, such as LIGO, and the next generation of space-based detectors, such as LISA.  In particular, LIGO is now taking data and its sensitivity is such that it is possible that gravitational waves from merging black holes will be detected in the next few years.  This research will be of particular importance to LIGO since its goal is to produce gravitational waveform templates to be used for gravitional wave data analysis.  This award provides important resources to support a new research-intensive program in numerical relativity at the Center for Computational Relativity and Gravitation (CCRG), recently created at the RIT.  The CCRG will provide a new research environment in which students are exposed to cutting-edge research and technology.  These students will learn critical skills in operating massively parallel computers, high performance computing and code optimization, visualization of complex 3-dimensional data, as well perform cutting edge research in strongly gravitating systems."

One of the key missions of LIGO and Virgo is to test Einstein's theory of General Relativity where it has never been tested before: where the gravitational force is enormous and violently changing. Gravitational waves encode invaluable information about this extreme gravity regime, especially in the waves produced when black holes and neutron stars collide. The main objective of this award is to develop ready-to-use models to extract and interpret gravitational waves emitted in eccentric and precessing collisions, so that these models can be used to study astrophysics and test General Relativity with future observations. This research will be integrated with broader impact activities aimed at changing the attitudes of K-12 students and the general public toward physics and science through activities that will be developed in the eXtreme Gravity Institute at Montana State University, a fertile training ground for the next generation of scientists. <br/><br/>This project is aimed at (i) the development of analytic, ready-to-use models for the orbital dynamics and gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral of generic compact binaries (black hole and neutron star binaries with arbitrary spin and eccentricity), and (ii) the use of these models to analyze and interpret current and future ground-based gravitational wave data to study astrophysics and experimental relativity implications. The gravitational wave models used currently are restricted to (at most nearly) quasi-circular inspirals with (typically) spins aligned/anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum (or to simple-precession-like approximations). Such models are sufficient for the detection and characterization of current GW observations, but as advanced LIGO is upgraded to reach design sensitivity and third-generation detectors are constructed, more accurate models will be needed. Not only will these models prevent the biasing of parameter estimation due to mis-modeling systematics, but the additional information they encode will allow for more accurate parameter estimation and the extraction of new information from the data. This new information, such as the orbital eccentricity and the spin vector components, can inform astrophysical population models, as well as allow for new tests of General Relativity in the mostly-unexplored, extreme gravity regime. The proposed research includes the implementation of the ready-to-use models in data analysis studies to determine the astrophysics and experimental-relativity information that can be extracted from current and future gravitational wave data.

Joint observations that combine telescopes, neutrino detectors, and new gravitational wave detectors including the NSF-supported LIGO Observatory are revealing aspects of the universe that are presently a mystery. Just recently, signals from the collision of two extremely dense neutron stars - a merger known as GW170817 - were detected by both conventional telescopes and gravitational wave detectors.  The event was detected first in gravitational waves, two seconds later in gamma rays, after 10 hours in optical, ultraviolet, infrared, and much later in x-ray and radio waves.  From this single event, the world learned that some short-hard gamma ray bursts indicate neutron star mergers, that these mergers might be the origin of many elements in the periodic table such as gold and platinum, that gravity and light travel at the same speed, and that gravitational waves really could measure how fast the universe is expanding.  Despite what was learned, GW170817 left the world with many questions. What object was formed afterward? Was it another neutron star? Was it a black hole? Why was the gamma ray burst associated with GW170817 unlike anything else that had been observed? Answering these questions, and conducting these kinds of joint observations on a regular basis, requires significant computing and software infrastructure (cyberinfrastructure).<br/><br/>The project proposes to develop the cyberinfrastructure necessary to give earlier gravitational event alerts to other astronomical facilities than is currently possible, allowing researchers to collect as much data as possible about these new types of celestial events. This project will fortify the streaming data delivery of LIGO by producing sub-second data delivery to a streaming early warning search for neutron star mergers. Substantial automated monitoring and feedback will ensure the entire system operates without manual intervention. The project will capitalize upon existing NSF investments in cyber-infrastructure for real-time gravitational wave analysis and will significantly augment the data delivery and automation layer for detections which is presently a bottleneck and failure mode. Using gravitational waves to provide an early warning for robotic telescopes will significantly enhance the scientific utility of LIGO data and significantly facilitate multi-messenger astrophysics.  This proposal will promote the progress of science in two of the National Science Foundation's 10 Big Ideas: ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" ""Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"". <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet in order to test Einstein's great theory, it is essential to know what it actually predicts for real measurements.  This project continues a program of research to provide concrete links between the abstract beauty and complex mathematics of Einstein's theory and the real world where measurements are made by physicists and astronomers.   These links are established by finding approximate, yet accurate solutions of the equations in forms that are practical and usable.    The outcomes of this research will be used by data experts at the gravitational-wave observatories to perform better tests of general relativity using newly detected signals, and will be used by astronomers to probe how general relativity affects complex systems such as stars orbiting supermassive black holes, or three-body systems involving bodies ranging from black holes to exoplanets.   Einstein's theory is a topic that fascinates the general public, and the PI will continue to give public lectures on topics related to this research, bringing understanding of Einstein's ideas to the broader community.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will contribute to the ability of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories such as the LIGO-Virgo network to test general relativity, by computing the equations of motion for binary star systems, along with the emitted gravitational waveforms, as predicted by an important alternative theory, known as Einstein-Aether gravity, to high accuracy in the so-called post-Newtonian approximation.  It will provide accurate waveforms predicted by this theory in a format that can be adapted to LIGO-Virgo data analysis methods.   Another important question that will be addressed is whether the evolution of binary orbits with general relativistic effects included leaves any residual orbital ellipticity in the final stages, leading to observable modulations of the gravitational signals emitted. The project also extends recent work of the PI on incorporating the effects of Einstein's theory into the dynamics of three-body systems, such as a star-exoplanet system in the presence of a third body, or a binary-black-hole system in a galactic core with a supermassive black hole at its center.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three major areas of application will be studied, each requiring special methods: computational relativity, certain important classes of differential equations arising from incompressible fluid flow and from electromagnetism, and linearly elastic plates.<br/><br/>In the area of computational relativity, the work is motivated by the search for gravitational radiation using the LIGO detector, presently under construction.  LIGO is the prime example of a new generation of gravitational wave detectors, and is being designed to detect gravity waves (which have hitherto escaped detection due to their small amplitude).  If the detected wave can be analyzed to determine the nature of the massive but distant astronomical event which gave birth to it (e.g., the spiraling coalescence of a pair of black holes), then LIGO will become mankind's first window on the universe that can ""see"" beyond the electromagnetic spectrum (light and radio signals).  The proposed project is to devise efficient algorithms to enable such analyses to be performed on high performance computers.  These algorithms are based on Einstein's equations underlying general relativity.  The investigator will both extend and apply already completed computer codes for the constraint equations, purely spatial partial differential equations arising from the Einstein equations, and will also study the problem of numerically solving the Einstein evolution equations.  This is highly interdisciplinary work, involving extensive collaboration between the investigator, a mathematician, and his group, and physicists and astronomers.<br/><br/>The second area of study concerns the developments of multigrid algorithms and supporting theory for solving certain sorts of differential equations which have hitherto resisted such approaches.  Multigrid algorithms, which exploit a decomposition of the desired solution into components on many different scales, are among the most efficient algorithms invented for solving many sorts of differential equations.  However for an important class of problems arising from incompressible continua and another group of problems arising from Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism, new multigrid approaches are required.<br/><br/>Finally the investigator will collaborate on a monograph on the theory of elastic plates, including modeling, analysis, and numerical simulation.  There has been extensive progress in these areas over the past decade, and the book will serve as both a reference for workers in the field and in the active field of elastic shell modeling, and as an introduction for researchers new to the area.<br/>"

One of the key missions of the LIGO project is to test Einstein's theory of General Relativity where it has never been tested before: where the gravitational forces are enormous compared to those found in the solar system. Such a task is achievable because gravitational waves encode information about the strong gravitational forces present when black holes and neutron stars collide to produce gravitational waves. This award supports a research program to develop and implement a generic and model-independent framework to test Einstein's theory of General Relativity and to search for anomalous deviations from it in gravitational wave data. The necessary tools to achieve this objective will be developed and implemented, so that they can be readily deployed in LIGO.<br/><br/>The research will enable exploitation of the full discovery potential of gravitational wave detection. This type of research is also timely and relevant, in view of upcoming, advanced detectors and the dawn of gravitational wave astrophysics. While the detection of a departure from Einstein's predictions could signal transformative new physics, the absence of such departures could provide strong confirmation for general relativity in an as yet untested regime."

The approach uses a fully tested 3-dimensional characteristic-evolution code for general relativity.  The code was developed by this group as part of the Binary Black Hole Grand Challenge Alliance.  The strategy for the boundary algorithm is Cauchy-characteristic matching, which carries out a global evolution using an interior Cauchy algorithm and an exterior characteristic algorithm, matched across a world-tube interface.  While neither of the two methods alone would cover the entire physical region of interest, they complement each other because they are applied where they are most appropriate - the Cauchy method near the sources and the characteristic method in the radiation zone.<br/><br/>General relativity, Einstein's reformulation of Newton's gravitational theory, predicts that accelerated masses produce gravitational waves analogous to the way charges produce electromagnetic waves or objects moving in a pond produce water waves.  The existence of gravitational waves has already been inferred from observations of the orbits of binary pulsars.  The LIGO observatories now under construction will be sensitive enough to detect directly gravitational waves from distant galaxies.  The goal of this project is to develop a method for calculating the properties of waves emitted when two black holes in a binary system inspiral and coalesce.  This is important for the success of LIGO.  Binary black holes are one of the prime sources of the waves, which LIGO is designed to detect.

The proposed research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental physics. The first real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes are just beginning to occur with experiments like LIGO. To confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the black holes that LIGO observes the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? The research will have an impact on astronomy.  Mergers of binary systems containing neutron stars can lead to the emission of electromagnetic and neutrino signals, as well as gravitational waves.  In one spectacular case so far, such an event has been detected by LIGO with gravitational waves, and also all across the electromagnetic spectrum. As more of these events are seen, better simulations are needed to help determine the parameters of these binaries and the characteristics of these signals (timescale, strength, etc.). The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand. Relativity and black holes continue to fascinate the public and allow science to be communicated broadly. Movies of simulations produced by the investigators will continue to provide public outreach.<br/><br/>To solve Einstein's equations, the investigators will use high-accuracy computational techniques suited to the mathematical properties of the equations.

Observations by astronomers of the motions of stars and gas near supermassive black holes, such as the one at the center of the Milky Way, have opened the possibility of testing Einstein's theory in realms where the warping of spacetime is extreme.   Yet in order to test Einstein's great theory, it is essential to know what it actually predicts for real measurements.  This project continues a program of research to provide concrete links between the abstract beauty and complex mathematics of Einstein's theory and the real world where measurements are made by physicists and astronomers.   These links are established by finding approximate, yet accurate solutions of the equations in forms that are practical and usable.    The solutions developed in this research will be used by data experts at the gravitational-wave observatories to perform better tests of general relativity using newly detected signals, and will be used by astronomers to probe how the warped spacetime near massive black holes affects stars orbiting such objects.  Einstein's theory is a topic that fascinates the general public, and the PI will continue to give public lectures on topics related to this research, bringing understanding of Einstein's ideas to the broader community.<br/><br/>Specifically, this project will contribute to the ability of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories such as the LIGO-Virgo network to test general relativity, by computing the equations of motion for binary star systems, along with the emitted gravitational waveforms, as predicted by an important alternative theory, known as scalar-tensor gravity, to high accuracy in the so-called post-Newtonian approximation.  It will provide accurate waveforms predicted by this theory in a format that can be adapted to LIGO-Virgo data analysis methods.  The approach extends a method known as Direct Integration of the Relaxed Einstein Equations that has been developed over many years by the PI and his collaborators.  The possibility of testing general relativity in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy using future infrared telescopes, proposed by the PI in 2008, will be investigated further.  The effects of general relativity on the structure and long-term evolution of clusters of stars around massive black holes will be studied using analytic means based on the post-Newtonian approximation."

The theory of gravity developed by Newton is not sufficient to describe the extreme densities in the CCSN mechanism. As such, CCSN represent an excellent test bed for Einstein's theory of gravity. This project will advance the description of gravity in current CCSN models, from an essentially Newtonian description with a simple correction accounting for some Einsteinian effects to a far more sophisticated approximation of Einsteinian gravity, thereby improving  significantly the realism of future CCSN studies. The new models will be used to make predictions for the emission of gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time, in core collapse supernovae. Such supernovae are among the three primary sources that will produce gravitational waves detectable by the Laser Interferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO). The PI will work closely with members of the LIGO Collaboration to develop new tools for LIGO data analysis. This project will train a graduate student in CCSN theory and gravitational wave astronomy and will provide a research opportunity for an intern in the Fisk-Vanderbilt Ph.D. program.<br/><br/>Advanced multi-physics models of core collapse supernovae that include multi-frequency neutrino transport with a complete set of neutrino weak interactions and key relativistic corrections such as gravitational redshift, have implemented to date only an effective self-gravitational potential, which is computed using the Newtonian potential obtained by solving the Poisson equation with a correction to the monopole term. The latter is determined from an integral formulation of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation using angle-average densities. More realistic CCSN models require more sophisticated treatments of the general relativistic gravity. In this project, the PI and his students will implement the Conformally Flat Approximation in CCSN models. This approximation has been shown to describe well general relativistic gravity in systems without rapid rotation or black hole formation, suitable for most CCSN studies. The new models will be used to compute the emission of gravitational radiation in CCSN models using the weak-field, slow-motion approximation and will provide new gravitational wave data to the gravitational wave astronomy community."

A code for evolving Einstein's equations in three spatial dimensions and with no special symmetries assumed is needed to produce binary coalescence simulations.

The construction and upgrade of the facilities used to enable scientific discovery in these disparate fields of research have led to a common pair of computational grand challenges: (i) datasets with ever-increasing complexity and volume; and (ii) data mining analyses that must be performed in real-time with oversubscribed computational resources. Furthermore, the convergence of gravitational wave astrophysics with electromagnetic and astroparticle surveys, the very birth of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, has already provided a glimpse of the transformational discoveries that it will enable in years to come. Given the unique potential for scientific discovery with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the combination of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics, the community needs to accelerate the development and exploitation of deep learning algorithms that will outperform existing approaches. This project serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science. It will push the frontiers of deep learning at scale, demonstrating the versatility and scalability of these methods to accelerate and enable new physics in the big data era. Because these methods are also applicable to many other parts of our national and global economy and society, this work will positively impact many fields. The students and junior scientists to be mentored and trained in this research will interact closely with our industry partners, creating new career opportunities, and strengthening synergies between academia and industry. The team will share the algorithms with the community through open source software repositories, and through our tutorials and workshops the team will train the community regarding software credit and software citation.<br/><br/>In this project, the PIs will build upon our recent work developing high quality deep learning algorithms for real-time data analytics of time-series and image datasets, as open source software. This work combines scalable deep learning algorithms, trained with TB-size datasets within minutes using thousands of GPUs/CPUs, with state-of-the-art approaches to endow the predictions of deterministic deep learning models with complete posterior distributions. The team will also investigate the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to accelerate low-latency inference of machine learning algorithms to minimize the demands of future computing, which is a central goal for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and particle physics. The open source tools to be developed as part of these activities will be readily shared with and adopted by LIGO, LHC, and LSST as core data analytics algorithms that will significantly increase the speed and depth of existing algorithms, enabling new physics while requiring minimal computational resources for real-time inferences analyses. The team will organize deep learning workshops and bootcamps to train students and researchers on how to use and contribute to our framework, creating a wide network of contributors and developers across key science missions.

Interferometric measurements, in which the phase difference between two waves is measured in order to gain information about the physical laws that cause such a phase difference, are among the most precise classes of measurements.  A spectacular illustration of the power of interferometry is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which has revealed the minescule ripples of the fabric of space-time caused by the merging of black holes in the cosmos, with three such events observed since the fall of 2015. Other prevalent examples of interferometry include high-resolution phase masks in microlithography, crucial to semiconductor chip fabrication and Moore's law in the computer industry; interferometric techniques for microscopy, such as phase contrast imaging in biology; and Ramsey interferometry, used for precise atomic clocks. Thus the results of this project can have a significant impact in a number of critical areas of technology.<br/><br/>The ultimate sensitivity of interferometers such as LIGO and atomic clocks is dictated by quantum mechanics. Indeed, any interferometer, for example an optical one, possesses intrisically quantum mechanical measurement noise floors which are consequences of the quantum duality between the undulatory  (electromagnetic wave) and corpuscular (photon) nature of light. Classical interferometers, such as LIGO and atomic clocks in their current versions, are shot-noise limited, which means their phase noise floor is of the order of the reciprocal of the square root of the average particle number (photon or atom) used in a measurement. However, this is far from the ultimate, Heisenberg, limit, which is of the order of the reciprocal of the average particle number. This limit can be reached by ""quantum engineering"" the light waves used in the interferometer. This project puts forward a new type of Heisenberg-limited interferometer, in which twin optical beams, the photon-correlated beams emitted by a optical parametric amplifier, see one photon subtracted from them in an indistinguishable manner before they are used as input in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. The project is unique among all previous proposals for Heisenberg-limited interferometry in that it features a Heisenberg-limited noise floor, a strong, direct interference fringe signal, and is experimentally feasible using state-of-the-art quantum optics technology that was previously demonstrated in the group of Prof. Pfister at the University of Virginia. If successful, this project could bring about multiple orders of magnitude measurement sensitivity improvement in phase-contrast imaging, which would allow nondestructive in vivo biological imaging by applying quantum light."

Investigation of the radio wave emission from the afterglow of GW170817 has provided key insights into the environment of the merger as well as the energy and morphology of the associated outflows. The late time confirmation of apparent superluminal motion has proved decisive in verifying the launch of a relativistic jet from the merger, as well as improving the use of mergers as ""standard sirens"" to constrain the Hubble constant of cosmology. With improved sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors LIGO and Virgo, the next few years will begin an era when neutron star mergers will be routinely detected in the local universe.  A research program at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will facilitate the discovery, follow up and interpretation of the radio afterglows from these mergers, produced by synchrotron light emission.  The investigators will make use of awarded observing time on the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and an approved program utilizing very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Simultaneously, this program will support new efforts to search for prompt low-frequency counterparts to these same events.  In addition, the investigators will develop a multi-faceted program involving student education spanning K-12 and undergraduate students. Three undergraduates will complete summer fellowships over the course of the project. The principal investigator (PI) will mentor six high school students from the Pasadena Unified School District to produce science fair projects themed on gravitational wave and multi-messenger astronomy. Finally, the PI will deliver three public lectures on gravitational wave sources to a broad audience via the Caltech Astronomy Stargazing and Public Lecture Series.<br/><br/>LIGO and Virgo will uncover a new population of nearby NS mergers. A comprehensive census of radio afterglow emission from these mergers will give insights into the physics of central engines, ejecta morphology and local environments of the merger. VLBI observations will be crucial for constraining the geometry of the mergers and hence for enabling precise measurements of the Hubble constant that can potentially resolve the tension between the Planck/CMB-Type Ia supernova discrepancy. Radio observations may provide the only means to detect an electromagnetic counterpart for a significant fraction of the mergers (30% or more; especially NS-black hole mergers). The results from the proposed research will also help in addressing key open questions in broader astronomy, including binary star evolution and compact binary merger history of the universe. Finally, this research facilitates sensitive searches for prompt low-frequency radio counterparts of mergers, which, while theoretically speculative, offers an exciting prospect - a prompt or precursor counterpart to LIGO/Virgo detected events.

The detection of gravitational waves from a coalescing binary neutron star system coincident with a gamma ray burst, with follow-up observations by traditional telescopes, demonstrated the power of multimessenger astronomy and the potential it holds. To continue making these discoveries, improvements to the sensitivity of existing gravitational wave observatories must be made, and the physics that will make the next generation of detectors possible must be developed. Quantum fluctuations of the laser fields used to measure gravitational waves will limit Advanced LIGO's sensitivity across most of its frequency bandwidth once it reaches design sensitivity. This project is focused on reducing the limitation of that quantum noise by exploiting the coupling of light to mechanical motion.<br/><br/>This project combines several of the key components that will make the next generation of detectors possible. Optical experiments will be conducted with microfabricated mechanical resonators with masses on the order of 100 nanograms. Specifically, the group will study the interaction of non-classical, or squeezed, states of light in an optomechanical cavity that is limited by both radiation pressure and shot noise in a broad frequency bandwidth, as Advanced LIGO is expected to be once it reaches design sensitivity. In order to achieve this goal, AlGaAs mirrors will be cryogenically cooled and placed in a high finesse optical cavity. Cryogenic operation will allow the Standard Quantum Limit to be approached, or even surpassed. At that sensitivity, these devices are good candidates for employing optomechanical interactions in filter cavities. Optomechanical filter cavities manipulate the coupling between radiation pressure and the mechanical degrees of freedom of the system to produce certain effects in light passing through the cavity. In principle, these filter cavities may be used to condition squeezed states of light to produce a frequency dependence suitable for injection to gravitational wave interferometers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gravitational-wave astronomy is one of the most rapidly evolving fields in astrophysics.  Over the past few years, the interferometer gravitational-wave observatories LIGO and Virgo have begun to record compact object mergers of black holes and neutron stars for the first time.  These discoveries are having a tremendous impact on our ability to study the population of black holes in our universe, learn about fundamental particle physics through study of the dense interiors of neutron stars, test general relativity as never before, and investigate a range of other topics.  Data from these cutting edge instruments are made available to the scientific community and the public  through the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC) at gw-openscience.org.  As LIGO and Virgo become more sensitive, the rate of discoveries is quickly accelerating.  Starting in 2015, the number of observed compact object mergers has grown from 1, to 10, to 50.  During the last observing run, LIGO and Virgo were observing mergers of black holes or neutron stars about once per week, and future upgrades are expected to make this rate grow.  As we begin to record hundreds or thousands of these astrophysical events, the scientific community will need a new set of tools to access and analyze the information associated with these discoveries.  This project will fund the construction of a new ?event portal?, which will allow scientists, teachers, students,  and enthusiasts around the world to browse catalogs of compact object mergers, study measurements of black hole properties, view graphics and plots, and listen to data converted to audio files, as well as download and analyze the associated interferometer data.  The award also includes funding to host an Open Data Workshop to train students and scientists who wish to contribute to this new field of astronomy.<br/><br/>Large collections of gravitational-wave events will invite a wide set of scientific investigations, but only if researchers with diverse interests are able to access and explore the associated data. Current structures on the GWOSC website provide only minimal support for derived data products (e.g., source parameters), and will not scale to hundreds of events. Going forward, the set of researchers interested in gravitational-wave science will likely broaden substantially to include more people interested in stellar populations, general relativity, nuclear astrophysics, and other fields. Many of these same people will be highly interested in derived data products, in addition to the gravitational-wave strain data GWOSC already hosts. Developing the event portal will enable these researchers to find and understand the data they need, and empower them to carry through their investigations.  In addition, both the event portal and the Open Data Workshop will make gravitational-wave science more accessible to a wider array of researchers. Because less expertise will be needed to engage with this science, the event portal will ?lower-the-bar? for entry into the field, and empower a more diverse group of scientists and students to benefit from GW observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Before the end of this decade it will open up the window of gravitational wave observations on the Universe. However, the high detector sensitivity needed for astrophysical discoveries makes aLIGO very susceptible to noncosmic artifacts and noise that must be identified and separated from cosmic signals. Teaching computers to identify and morphologically classify these artifacts in detector data is exceedingly difficult. Human eyesight is a proven tool for classification, but the aLIGO data streams from approximately 30,000 sensors and monitors easily overwhelm a single human. This research will address these problems by coupling human classification with a machine learning model that learns from the citizen scientists and also guides how information is provided to participants. A novel feature of this system will be its reliance on volunteers to discover new glitch classes, not just use existing ones. The project includes research on the human-centered computing aspects of this sociocomputational system, and thus can inspire future citizen science projects that do not merely exploit the labor of volunteers but engage them as partners in scientific discovery.  Therefore, the project will have substantial educational benefits for the volunteers, who will gain a good understanding on how science works, and will be a part of the excitement of opening up a new window on the universe.<br/><br/>This is an innovative, interdisciplinary collaboration between the existing LIGO, at the time it is being technically enhanced, and Zooniverse, which has fielded a workable crowdsourcing model, currently involving over a million people on 30 projects.  The work will help aLIGO to quickly identify noise and artifacts in the science data stream, separating out legitimate astrophysical events, and allowing those events to be distributed to other observatories for more detailed source identification and study. This project will also build and evaluate an interface between machine learning and human learning that will itself be an advance on current methods. It can be depicted as a loop: (1) By sifting through enormous amounts of aLIGO data, the citizen scientists will produce a robust ""gold standard"" glitch dataset that can be used to seed and train machine learning algorithms that will aid in the identification task. (2) The machine learning protocols that select and classify glitch events will be developed to maximize the potential of the citizen scientists by organizing and passing the data to them in more effective ways. The project will experiment with the task design and workflow organization (leveraging previous Zooniverse experience) to build a system that takes advantage of the distinctive strengths of the machines (ability to process large amounts of data systematically) and the humans (ability to identify patterns and spot discrepancies), and then using the model to enable high quality aLIGO detector characterization and gravitational wave searches."

Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before.  Along with these tremendous advances in instrumentation, it has been known from the very inception of the gravitational wave physics effort that the envelope of statistical data analysis techniques must also be pushed further to enable the detection of weak and rare signals embedded in noise. It is in this area that the research funded by this grant will make significant contributions. By supporting graduate students, this grant will help to grow the community of researchers in this field. Since the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) is an Hispanic serving institution, the research activities will expose students who are traditionally under-represented in STEM areas to forefront science. Ongoing major education and outreach activities at UTB will leverage these activities to create awareness among high-school students about exciting projects such as LIGO.<br/><br/>This grant supports research projects in the following major data analysis areas. (i) An algorithm will be developed and implemented that allows the construction of sky maps of an anisotropic background of stochastic gravitational waves with minimal prior assumptions. Using methods originally developed in the context of pulsar-timing-based gravitational-wave searches, the new approach will vastly extend the capabilities of existing model-dependent searches. A Bayesian alternative to the standard frequentist stochastic search will also be developed that will leverage existing code for Bayesian inference in the context of detector characterization and noise estimation. (ii) A smoothness-regularization-based coherent network analysis method will be implemented that significantly improves the detection and characterization of burst gravitational wave signals having non-compact time-frequency (TF) signatures. Such signals are expected to arise in a variety of astrophysical scenarios but are known to pose a significant challenge to existing methods. (iii) A new method, derived from the Harmonic Regeneration Noise Reduction (HRNR) technique developed in acoustical signal processing, will be integrated with existing network analysis pipelines to boost their sensitivity to post-core-bounce-phase supernova signals. By improving both signal waveform and sky location estimation, this will lead to better multi-messenger follow up of such a rare but dramatic event. (iv) The characterization of detector noise and non-gravitational wave signals (""glitches"") in the data is necessary for improving detection confidence for genuine gravitational-wave signals. In this context, the Self Organizing Map (SOM) method will be used for instrumental glitch classification, and glitch characteristics relevant to aLIGO will be catalogued. An independent approach will use the BayesWave Bayesian inference pipeline to identify and study glitch signals."

An analogous background of electromagnetic origin was discovered fifty years ago, but it originated at a much later time in the evolution of the Universe. This search takes advantage of LIGO's high sensitivity at gravitational wave wavelengths that are sub-multiples of the interferometer arm length. In addition, at such wavelengths, the gravitational signal has a distinct spectral shape that can facilitate its identification in the presence of a much higher level of instrumental noise.<br/>The discovery of this effect would make possible a look at the earliest epoch of the cosmos and would drastically impact the understanding of our world. The analysis of the LIGO data to search for this effect requires algorithm development and large scale computing.

Since GW signals are weak compared to the intrinsic noise in the detectors, success in detecting and measuring these signals depends critically on the use of powerful data analysis techniques. S.D. Mohanty (PI), S. Mukherjee (co-PI) and J. Romano (co-PI) will work on data analysis projects in three key areas: (1) search for GWs from Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), (2) characterizing the statistical properties of detector noise and (3) search for stochastic GW signals. There will be a significant effort directed at education and outreach. Lecture modules anchored to the above research projects and incorporating hands-on activities will be developed. Among other venues, the lectures will be given during ""The 21st Century Astronomy Ambassador's Program,"" at the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB) which targets local high school students from the predominantly Hispanic population of Brownsville and neighboring areas.<br/>The research projects above are motivated by exciting possibilities. GRBs are the most energetic explosions in the Universe yet known. The SWIFT mission operated by NASA is dedicated to observing these enigmatic events. GRBs arise if a black hole is formed as an end product of the death of a star. If we could detect and measure the GW signature of GRBs, we could learn a lot about the formation process of the black hole. Stochastic GW signals could arise from a variety of possible sources, such as the superposition of many weak and otherwise unobserved GRBs. However, the most important stochastic signal is the one left over from the Big Bang itself. The detection of this signal will revolutionize our understanding of the origin of the Universe. In order to detect and measure GW signals, it is critical that we understand the noise in our detectors very well. Given the enormous rate of data collection, this work requires exploiting methods at the frontiers of research in statistics, data mining and machine learning. <br/>These research projects will expose students at UTB, a minority serving institution, to the cutting edge of astronomy and astrophysics. Education and outreach to a community that is traditionally under-represented in science and technology will help promote greater interest in these areas. The activities involving high school students will be an essential tool in helping to recruit them into the physical sciences, thus helping to advance NSF's mission of increasing minority participation in this area. <br/><br/>"

In the last five years, the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration has detected several gravitational wave signals from merging binary systems consisting of black holes and neutron stars. These observations are already yielding new insights into the assembly and evolution of stellar remnants in the Universe, which are currently limited by the low numbers of events. In this context, the award supports research that will push forward innovative methods to (a) understand and mitigate factors that limit the sensitivity of the searches, and (b) characterize the properties of the signals that are detected. This approach is complementary to hardware improvements that boost the sensitivity, and by helping to detect and characterize the faintest and most distant signals, will help maximize the scientific yield of the LIGO-VIRGO observations. The resultant rapid and robust understanding of the source properties will also help better guide subsequent observations. The program will also facilitate NSF?s long-term vision on expanding the gravitational wave community by developing broader expertise in analyzing the LIGO strain data, releasing more derived data products, engaging and involving local undergraduate and high school students in the research, and organizing a pedagogical workshop for the wider field. <br/><br/>The research plan has two components. The first aim is to characterize and better mitigate two systematics that have been proven to affect the noise background, and consequently affect the sensitivity of searches: very short time-scale glitches in the detector, which are known to be extremely localized in parameter space, and moderate to longer-term variations in the noise characteristics, which affect the precision on the recovered signal-to-noise ratios of events. These systematics have been previously identified, but with the expanded level of detail that would be achieved in this research, it is possible to develop simple measures to curb their impact that are natural extensions of existing methods (such as signal-quality vetos and re-weighted signal-to-noise ratios). The second aim is to improve existing parameter estimation pipelines to help rapidly and robustly infer the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of gravitational wave sources. The methods build on existing codes that exploit the frequency structure of the signals (i.e., the smooth behavior of their phase with frequency), and insights from the searches on how to insulate the detection process from localized instrumental artifacts, i.e., glitches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combining gravitational waves with electromagnetic observations through multi-messenger astronomy will maximize the information available and allow scientific discoveries that would not be possible with either alone. Our research focuses on three specific projects. The first of these involves searches for gravitational waves in coincidence with short duration radio pulses. Radio signals are a potentially crucial component of a full program of multi-messenger astronomy in the advanced detector era. In some cases, radio emission may be the only observable signal in the direction of the Earth aside from gravitational waves. Using pulses from currently existing Green Bank Telescope pulsar surveys as external triggers in LIGO/Virgo searches will allow us to probe deeper into our current data and set the stage for future coincident analyses between radio signals and gravitational waves. The other direction in which multi-messenger astronomy can be performed, and our second area of focus, entails the follow-up of potential gravitational wave triggers with instruments looking for other astronomical messengers. Regardless of the method employed to detect a signal, having the best data possible to work with will be critical in successfully detecting gravitational waves.  Thus, the third area of focus is in detector characterization, the understanding and mitigation of transient disturbances in the detector that may be confused with astrophysical signals, including developmental studies, as well as well as work maintaining software and validating the calibration of the instruments.<br/><br/>Direct confirmation of Einstein's general theory of relativity through the observation of gravitational waves would be a major accomplishment of 21st century physics, with consequences in gravitational theory as well as astronomy and astrophysics.  Validating this observation with coincident emission of photons from the same event would increase our confidence in such an observation.  Additionally, a multi-messenger approach to astronomy, ""hearing the universe"" through gravitational waves as  well as seeing it through optical, x-ray or radio astronomy, will allow us to gain a more complete scientific picture of the sky around us, potentially including such  phenomena as gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. Since the research is carried out at a primarily undergraduate institution and fully integrates undergraduate researchers, this grant also facilitates the critical task of preparing the next generation of physicists."

The Phase II Center will initiate a new era, greatly expanding and improving its educational and research activities. Since its creation, the CGWA has become a major group-member of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration (LSC), the world-wide collaboration of 800 scientists from more than 30 institutions and thirteen countries that seeks to make the first direct detection of gravitational waves and use them as a new window onto the universe. The next five years will see the CGWA involved in research in which gravitational-wave observations are routinely conducted in astronomy. This new era is also ushering in a new multi-disciplinary approach to study astrophysical phenomena, called multi-messenger astronomy.  The CGWA will pursue theoretical and experimental research activities, which seek to complement gravitational-wave detections with independent observations using optical and radio astronomy. The proposed research consists of: (i) Astrophysics, in collaboration with UTB's new Center for Advanced Radio Astronomy (CARA), that seeks to tie gravitational-wave observations to electromagnetic observations and astrophysical evolutionary theory; (ii) Data Analysis that concentrates on improved methods to search for gravitational waves, which can then be used as triggers for electromagnetic observations; and (iii) Detector Instrumentation that focuses on individual subsystems of the detectors and their noise-limited performance, with the goal to provide scientific guidelines for the concept and design of the next-generation of gravitational-wave detectors.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The Astrophysics Subproject supports multi-messenger astronomy by concentrating on the electromagnetic follow-ups of future triggers generated by gravitational-wave detectors such as advanced LIGO. The observational efforts at the Center include radio and optical follow-up of suspected gravitational waves from the collapse of compact binary stars. The population modeling aims at developing an astrophysical framework to understand the process of formation of such compact binary stars. The Data Analysis Subproject utilizes advanced statistical techniques to model realistic noise sources and provide improved estimates of astrophysical factors, such as the sky location of a gravitational-wave transient. The Instrumentation Subproject focuses its research on subsystems of current and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors. In particular, investigations of certain optical components, and experiments with test mass suspensions are crucial for finding the limitations of current and future gravitational wave detectors. Their relevance to LIGO, and to the scientific community in general, is only heightened by the fact that recent improvements in the growing network of gravitational-wave detectors greatly increase the probability of first detections shortly after the advanced detectors come on-line around 2015.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>A major educational impact will be realized with the CGWA Instrumentation effort, which involves students in experimental physics research and provides hands-on training in gravitational-wave detector subsystems. The CGWA Optics and Material Science laboratories offer unprecedented research experiences for students at UTB. The scholarship program for undergraduates, run by CARA, will provide mentorship for students and monitor their success through CARA's highly successful Arecibo Remote Command Center Program. The CGWA will also sustain a robust outreach effort to the community by providing access to its astronomical observatory to the general public. The CGWA visitors and conference program will provide a valuable resource for other interested scientists to get involved in the new field of the multi-messenger astronomy. The University of Texas at Brownsville is a Hispanic serving institution and consequently the CGWA's research and educational programs will play a major role in attracting Hispanic students to STEM disciplines in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the most educationally and socially underserved regions of the USA."

Predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity (GR) - the most commonly accepted model of gravity - gravitational waves have not been detected yet. The direct observations of gravitational waves would be one of the most fundamental results in the modern science and the ultimate test of GR. Also gravitational waves will be a radically new tool for exploring fundamental physics and astronomy. They will probe the physics driving the most violent astrophysical events in the universe in ways inaccessible to electromagnetic astronomy. The construction of the U.S. Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (aLIGO) is almost complete. The aLIGO detectors will conduct the first observations in the fall 2015. Within the next few years, aLIGO and its international partner detectors Virgo and Kagra expect to make the first detections of gravitational waves from merging compact binary objects, such as neutron stars and black holes. Gravitational waves produced by the collision of black holes, asymmetric core collapse supernovae, rapidly spinning neutron stars, and even by the Big Bang itself are targets for detection in the years to come. <br/><br/>This award supports high priority searches for gravitational-wave transients from a broad class of astrophysical sources. These searches are capable of detecting gravitational transients in a wide range of source parameters, including yet unknown sources. They target the most extreme astrophysical events, such as supernovae, gamma-ray-bursts, mergers of neutron stars and black holes, and hold a promise for discoveries of entirely new astrophysical phenomena. Also, they will extend the most promising advanced LIGO searches for compact binary sources into the binary parameter space not covered by the existing template algorithms. These searches have a potential to establish the existence of intermediate mass binary black holes, look inside the galactic nuclei by detecting binaries with the eccentric orbits, and test the theory of general relativity at high field regime with the intermediate mass ratio binary sources. Rapid source reconstruction and sky localization will enable joint observations, with the electromagnetic telescopes advancing the field of the multi-messenger astronomy. Sophisticated signal processing algorithms and source reconstruction methods will be implemented and applied to find the source polarization and waveforms. A novel wavelet regression method will be used for the analysis and characterization of aLIGO data, targeting identification, monitoring and cancellation of environmental noise coupled into the detector output. Studies of noise sources will be performed and novel noise cancellation techniques will be tested to enable the first confident detection of gravitational-wave transients."

Specifically the following three main research projects are targeted: (i) parameter estimation for binaries with two compact objects using advanced applied mathematics methods, including the advancement of algorithms and computational tools, so that we can measure masses and spins of black holes and neutron stars and localize their GW emission on the sky so we can understand their physical origin; (ii) development of a quantitative framework for using GW event rates to derive constraints on astrophysical models of compact-object binary formation and evolution; and (iii) the astrophysical interpretation of multiple GW detections and associated mass and spin measurements, accounting quantitatively for GW observational biases and selection effects. Furthermore, the involvement in public outreach activities is intended to strengthen the connection between astronomy and GW physics, by focusing on projects that explain the formation of GW sources to the public.<br/><br/>This work is of interest to the broader community of compact-object astrophysics in a wide range of contexts: e.g., stellar and binary system evolution, neutron star and black hole formation, gamma-ray bursts, stellar dynamics of globular clusters and galactic centers, as in the coming years LIGO observations can provide uniquely reliable answers to some of the long-standing questions in astronomy and astrophysics. The computational tools to be developed will be made available within and outside the LSC, and hence can benefit other LSC projects and enhance the research infrastructure for parameter estimation in other scientific and engineering contexts. Outreach activities take advantage of the existing collaboration with the Adler Planetarium & Astronomy Museum with hundreds of thousands of visitors per year; this connection ensures the broad dissemination of research understanding in the diverse, urban environment of the Chicago metropolitan area.

The anticipated ""dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy"" will enable detailed analysis of the science reach of gravitational-wave searches. Building on past experience the Columbia Experimental Gravity group's scientific focus will be on the foundations, implications and science extraction from joint searches that may involve neutrinos, electromagnetic and other counterparts to gravitational-waves from cosmic explosions, mergers, and other sources."

The numerical solution of this problem has proved to be remarkably difficult.  The investigators will use a new computational technique on the problem, pseudospectral collocation.

Rather than considering the entire sky at once, the search considers individual sky regions and is expected to produce the world's best limits on stochastic gravitational radiation. Additionally  the award supports (ii) the development of an all-optical trap for a small mirror, a step that could lead to improved sensitivity in next generation gravitational wave detectors. Radiation pressure, together with the optical cavity dynamics, will provide the trapping force without the need for active feed-back. <br/> <br/>Primordial gravitational waves in the LIGO observation band were generated in the early universe at energy densities beyond the experimentally-tested regime of the Standard Model of particle physics and have the potential to reveal new physics. Observing these waves may be the biggest prize gravitational-wave astronomy has to offer. Looking beyond existing gravitational-wave detectors, optical trapping of a test mirror using radiation pressure will allow the manipulation of macroscopic objects at the quantum level, and can lead to an improved angular control system for the next-generation gravitational-wave interferometers. The project will also provide hands-on experience for undergraduate students and training for graduate students on actual LIGO interferometer hardware."

This project will design computer models to study gravitational radiation from compact object binaries. This will include studying how the internal structure of neutron stars affects the gravitational radiation emitted in a binary merger. Additional work will investigate opportunities for multiple messenger astronomy, in which data from several types of observations are combined to obtain a more complete picture. In particular, this project will study possible emission of electromagnetic radiation and neutrinos from the merger of neutron stars and black holes.<br/><br/>This research is of broad interest reaching beyond physicists to astrophysicists, mathematicians, and the general public (for whom movies will be posted to the web). The connection of gravitational, electromagnetic and neutrino data from black hole and neutron star mergers will significantly advance our understanding of some of the most intriguing processes in the universe. This work will provide valuable candidate waveforms for gravitational wave observatories, including LIGO. As part of a multinational effort to compare such waveforms, this work will be especially valuable to the gravitational wave community in their efforts to detect this radiation. Information that comes from these gravitational waves will lead to a better understanding of the internal structure of neutron stars and matter at nuclear densities. The activities described here will provide educational and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups. This work uses the HAD computational infrastructure, and thus supports this broadly useful, publicly available software for scientific computing."

Its long-term goals are: (1) to maximize the scientific payoff from gravitational-wave observations: what can we learn about fundamental gravitational physics, and how will compact binary detections contribute to our understanding of the Universe? (2) to improve our theoretical understanding of compact objects, whether isolated or in binaries, in general relativity and in modified theories of gravity. With the expected increase in volume coverage of LIGO/Virgo and the operation of KAGRA in Japan, this work is timely, geared at enhancing the scope of the physics and astrophysics enabled by ground-based interferometers. The project will train a student in a highly interdisciplinary field that requires expertise in general relativity, astrophysics, data analysis and high-energy physics. The PI's newly established group at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in Baltimore has long-standing collaborations with groups in the US and in the EU. This network of collaborations will ensure that the student funded by this project will be trained in a vibrant international environment. A key goal of the project is to strengthen collaborations between the gravitational physics community and the larger physics and astrophysics communities at a crucial time for the nascent field of gravitational-wave astronomy. JHU has formal collaborations with the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) and NASA Goddard (GSFC) and it is home to many world-leading experts in cosmology and astrophysics, so this task will benefit enormously from the group's daily interactions with JHU faculty and STScI astronomers. The PI has a strong track record of training students and postdocs who developed into leading experts working at the interface of these different fields.<br/><br/>The first gravitational-wave detections by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration were a major milestone. Large financial resources have been invested in detector design and in compact binary detection templates, but for gravitational-wave science to make even more groundbreaking contributions we must be able to go beyond detections, extracting fundamental physics from the strong-gravity dynamics of the sources. The PI will investigate the structure and dynamics of compact objects in general relativity and in some well-motivated modified theories of gravity. The theoretical insight gained from these investigations will be used to devise a parametrized, theory-agnostic gravitational-wave data analysis framework to quantify dynamical deviations from general relativity for compact binary mergers in the strong-field regime. To address this problem, the PI's group will adopt the following strategy: (1) identify the simplest, best-motivated modified theories of gravity and physics beyond the Standard Model that would produce black hole spacetimes and/or binary black hole gravitational waveforms that differ from general relativity; (2) compute the corresponding black hole solutions and (whenever possible) the gravitational waves emitted during binary merger and ringdown using a combination of perturbation theory and/or numerical relativity; (3) use these results to learn lessons on how to parametrize strong-field deviations from general relativity in a theory-agnostic way, and implement these parametrizations in gravitational-wave data analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research project is devoted to the analysis and modeling of gravitational waves. These ripples in the very fabric of space and time are produced when the densest objects in the Universe -- such as black holes and neutron stars -- orbit and collide. The detection of gravitational waves by the NSF-funded LIGO and European Virgo collaborations has opened up a new window on the Universe, revealing previously invisible events like pairs of black holes merging. Members of the Austin Relativity group will participate in the analysis of gravitational waves as members of the LIGO collaboration, helping to infer the properties of the sources of these ripples. To ensure the maximum scientific benefit from the detection of gravitational waves, models for how these waves are produced require continuing refinement. Members of the research group will perform numerical simulations on supercomputers in order to explore the orbit and collision of pairs of black holes. The focus will be on extreme configurations -- such as systems with very unequal masses and complicated orbits -- with the goal of making new connections to pen and paper approximations for how gravitational waves are produced in these cases. These research activities will provide training for graduate students in high-performance computing and data analysis, skillsets which are in great demand and of great benefit to society. In addition, members of the group will engage in outreach activities in order to educate and inspire the public about this new field of physics and astronomy. Finally, members of the group will participate in outreach to high school women, in order to promote diversity within STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the study of binary black holes with significantly different masses, whose gravitational waves are challenging to model. This project will connect numerical simulations of these binaries with analytical approximations which are capable of modeling binaries with very unequal masses, in particular the self-force approximation. Targeted simulations will test the self-force and other approximations, provide independent verification of their predictions, reveal their limitations, and point to refined approaches for use in GW science. The key tool for making comparisons will be invariant quantities, such as the redshift factor and orbital frequency shifts of the black holes. Advances in modeling these binaries will have immediate benefits for the current era of GW detectors, and will be crucial for the success of future, space-based missions. In addition, the PI and other members of the research group will directly participate in the analysis of gravitational waves. Members of the group measure the properties of these binaries which produce these waves using Bayesian parameter estimation. These inferences are a crucial first step in the use of gravitational wave detections for understanding the population of binary black holes, inferring the nuclear equation of state from observations of binary neutron stars, testing the theory of relativity, and using gravitational waves to measure cosmic expansion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They have sparked a very broad range of studies, from new tests of General Relativity and the measurement of the Hubble constant to constraints on the equation of state in neutron stars and studies of the r-process of heavy element production in the binary neutron star merger. Adding the gravitational wave signals from all such binaries in the universe leads to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). The above discoveries have enabled a robust estimate of this background, indicating that it is within reach of the upcoming observation runs of aLIGO and aVirgo. The SGWB may well be the next new type of gravitational-wave signal to be discovered by these detectors, with the discovery coming potentially as early as 2019.  This project aims to measure (and detect) the SGWB using data from upcoming observation runs of aLIGO and aVirgo, improving the sensitivity by up to 100x relative to the most recent results. The project will support involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in research at the frontier of the nascent field of multi-messenger astrophysics, as well as activities designed to share the excitement of this new field with broader audience.<br/><br/>More specifically, using cross-correlation techniques applied to aLIGO and aVirgo data, the frequency content and temporal structure of the SGWB will be measured. Bayesian parameter estimation framework will then use this information to estimate the contributions of various astrophysical and cosmological SGWB models, as well as to identify and remove environmental contamination, such as due to the Schumann magnetic resonances. The results of this analysis are expected to place stringent constraints on the formation and evolution of compact binary systems, hence illuminating the evolution of the observed structure in the universe. Furthermore, these results will have the potential to constrain cosmological SGWB models, such as inflationary or cosmic (super)string models, and therefore probe the physics of fundamental interactions at very high energies, unachievable in laboratories. Similar cross correlation techniques will also be used to develop new searches for long transient signals, lasting from hours to days or weeks, which are expected in multiple models of neutron stars and are of particular interest for studying the remnants of binary neutron star mergers. If detected, such a signal would provide information about the physics processes driving Gamma Ray Bursts and about the high-density state of nuclear matter in neutron stars. To further improve the sensitivity of these searches, deep machine learning techniques will be used to remove the environmental contamination from the aLIGO and aVirgo gravitational-wave data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Workflow management systems allow scientists to describe their process in a human-friendly way and then the software handles the details of the processing for the scientists, dealing with tedious and repetitive steps and handling errors. One popular workflow management system is Pegasus, which, over the past three years, was used to run over 700,000 workflows by scientists in a number of domains including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, gravitational wave physics, ocean science, and neuroscience. The ""Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus"" project enhances Pegasus with additional security features. The scientist's description of their desired work is protected from tampering and the data processed by Pegasus is checked to ensure it hasn't been accidentally or maliciously modified. Such tamper protection is attained by cryptographic techniques that ensure data integrity. These changes allow scientists, and our society, to be more confident of scientific findings based on collected data.<br/><br/>The Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus project strengthens cybersecurity controls in the Pegasus Workflow Management System in order to provide assurances with respect to the integrity of computational scientific methods. These strengthened controls enhance both Pegasus' handling of science data and its orchestration of software-defined networks and infrastructure. The result is increased trust in computational science and increased assurance in our ability to reproduce the science by allowing scientists to validate that data has not been changed since a workflow completed and that the results from multiple workflows are consistent. The focus on Pegasus is due to its popularity in the scientific community as a method of computation and data management automation. For example, LIGO, the NSF-funded gravitational-wave physics project, recently used the Pegasus Workflow Management System to structure and execute the analyses that confirmed and quantified its historic detection of a gravitational wave, confirming the prediction made by Einstein 100 years ago. The proposed project has established collaborations with LIGO and additional key NSF infrastructure providers and science projects to ensure broadly applied results."

Neutron stars are extremely compact objects, and their collision provides us with an extraordinary laboratory to test the laws of gravity and nuclear physics. They also power some of the most energetic electromagnetic signals observed in the Universe, and may be the main production site of gold, platinum, and many other elements. This project will use numerical simulations to produce publicly available, high-accuracy predictions for the gravitational waves emitted by colliding neutron stars. With these results, models of the gravitational wave signal can be brought to an accuracy sufficient to avoid the introduction of significant errors in the analysis of upcoming LIGO results. This project will also lead to the development of novel methods to simulate the complex physical processes that determine the properties of the electromagnetic signals powered by colliding neutron stars, particularly the interaction of neutrinos with neutron star material. Understanding these interactions is critical to analyzing electromagnetic signals emitted after the collision, and to determine the role of neutron star collisions in the enrichment of the Universe in gold and other atomic nuclei. This project will leverage the power of joint observations of gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals to study the Universe. It also funds the training of graduate and undergraduate students with advanced skills in numerical modeling transferable to careers in either academia or industry.<br/><br/>This project will use the general relativistic radiation-hydrodynamics SpEC code to simulate the late inspiral and merger of neutron star binaries. The main goal of the project is to generate a library of high-accuracy numerical waveforms covering the parameter space of merging neutron stars: the mass and spin of each star, and the equation of state of nuclear matter. The project will leverage one of the main strengths of the SpEC code: its ability to efficiently evolve neutron star binaries over many orbits, for sufficiently smooth equation of state models. As a result of this project, dozens of waveforms for neutron star binaries will be made publicly available. Particular attention will be paid to error estimates, in order to facilitate the use of the simulations for the calibration of analytical waveform models, and to the automation of the simulations. A secondary objective of this project will be the development of smooth approximations to the equation of state, as the SpEC code is significantly more efficient when evolving smooth equations of state than for the discontinuous approximations that are more commonly used today. Finally, this project will lead to the development and use in merger simulations of a recently proposed algorithm for neutrino transport, which combines the currently used ""two-moment"" transport formalism with a more advanced Monte-Carlo transport algorithm. In this hybrid scheme, the use of Monte-Carlo transport removes the need to use approximate analytical prescriptions to close the equations of radiation transport. This new scheme will be particularly powerful to determine the role of neutrinos in the production of relativistic polar outflows after a neutron star merger, and their impact on the composition of matter outflows and the properties of kilonovae.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since then LIGO has detected a few more binary neutron star systems and many more are expected in the future. These discoveries are starting to revolutionize our understanding of, among others, high energy astrophysics phenomena, such as short gamma-ray bursts, the properties of matter under extreme conditions, and the origin of heavy elements, such as gold and platinum. However, to make fundamental progress observations need to be complemented by theoretical understanding. This project aims to build a pipeline for the joint analysis of the different messengers in multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers. To this aim, data analysis techniques and large-scale supercomputer simulations of neutron star mergers will be combined. The project will constitute the bulk of the PhD thesis of one graduate student at Penn State, who will acquire skills in high demand in the academic and industry job markets. Numerical methods developed for these simulations could also find applications in other STEM fields. Numerical simulations of neutron star and black hole spacetimes will also be used to create an immersive and interactive virtual reality exploratorium for compact objects to be used for classroom teaching and outreach.<br/><br/>The most common multimessenger observations of neutron star mergers are expected to combine gravitational waves and UV/optical/infrared photons generated as radioactive byproducts of the nucleosynthesis process decay.

Many-orbit high-resolution inspiral and merger simulations will be performed in full general-relativity using newly developed high-order numerical techniques based on the entropy viscosity method to deliver convergent gravitational wave strain data extending down to the post Newtonian regime and up to the kilohertz regime, where current models start to fail. The numerical relativity data will be used to construct new frequency domain phenomenological waveform models suited for Bayesian parameter estimation. Long-term merger and post-merger simulations with microphysics and subgrid turbulence models will be performed to predict the quality and quantity of the outflows that ultimately power the kilonovae as a function of the binary parameters, such as the total mass, the tidal deformability, and, in particular, the binary mass ratio. The numerical data will be combined with a semi-analytic kilonova model calibrated against full radiative transfer calculations to construct a model of the kilonova emission as a function of the binary parameters.

To understand this unprecedented wealth of observational evidence, theoretical calculations are required in order to link data with underlying physics.  However, these demand the creation of new computational tools that can handle an increasingly wide range of physical treatments, characteristic scales, and levels of complexity. The main thrust of this project is to develop some of these tools.<br/><br/>The principal goals supported by this award are to introduce two new techniques into the repertory of physicists and astrophysicists studying strong-field gravity: multipatch methods and regularized spherical coordinates.  The former is an infrastructure to permit efficient computation of heterogeneous systems involving multiple kinds of physics, multiple length scales, and multiple reference frames. The latter is a way to systematically remove from partial differential equations the singularity ordinarily arising at the polar axis. We expect both will be of great value to studies of astrophysical objects in dynamical spacetimes.  To make this introduction, we will generalize our multipatch infrastructure to make it freely compatible with many codes, including Athena++, The Einstein Toolkit, and Harm3D; we will introduce regularized spherical coordinates into the numerical relativity and MHD solvers of both the Einstein Toolkit and the widely used relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code Harm3D; and we will demonstrate the results on selected science problems. With Advanced LIGO now fully operational and the detection of additional gravitational wave events imminent, we expect that there will be a surge in the number of researchers interested in performing simulations of compact binary mergers.   Our new curvilinear and multipatch frameworks will greatly improve the efficiency and ease with which such simulations may be carried out, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions made for all the messengers---gravitational waves, photons, and neutrinos---of multi-messenger astronomy."

First, it will study the evolution of the nuclear matter debris left around the post-merger black hole, especially the effects of magnetic fields and neutrino radiation that are expected to be critical in delivering energy to a GRB.  Second, it will explore the variety of black hole-neutron star binaries by modeling currently unstudied extremes of black hole mass and spin.  Third, it will characterize the effects of neutron star physics on the gravitational waveforms.<br/><br/>Accurate gravitational waveform predictions will be crucial for detecting binary merger signals in LIGO data and for extracting information about the neutron star structure.  Such information might be able to constrain unknown properties of nuclear matter.  Numerical techniques developed for this project will be applicable to other problems in astrophysical fluid dynamics.  Most of the funding from this award is used for student support.  The PI directs both graduate and undergraduate students.  These students receive valuable training in computer programming, numerical problem solving, and hydrodynamics, gaining important skills applicable to a broad range of technical fields.  Results from this project will be used in communicating the excitement of astrophysics to the wider public."

This breakthrough marks the beginning of the era of GW astronomy. They also provide the strongest evidence yet that Einstein's theory of general relativity (GR) is the correct theory of gravity and that binary and spinning black holes exist with the properties prescribed by GR. The research funded within this project spans several problems involving GR, the generation of GWs, relativistic hydrodynamics (fluid flow in strong gravitational fields and moving at the speed of light)) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (fluid flow in magnetic fields). A common thread uniting the different theoretical topics is the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic gravitation. Compact objects (black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs) provide the principal forum, and the dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field is a major theme. Some of the topics for investigation include the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries (binary black holes, binary neutron stars and  binary black hole--neutron stars), the generation of GWs from compact binaries and other promising astrophysical sources and the electromagnetic signals that may accompany them (e.g., gamma-ray bursts), gravitational collapse, circumbinary disks around merging supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and quasars, and the profile and observable consequences of dark matter (the major form of matter in the universe and unlike normal atoms and their constituents) around supermassive black holes in galaxy cores, including the Milky Way. The results have important implications for astronomical observations, including those planned for GW interferometers, such as the Advanced LIGO/VIRGO network, GEO, KAGRA, the PTAs and LISA, and transient-event electromagnetic detectors, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).<br/><br/>Most of these topics represent long-standing, fundamental problems in theoretical physics requiring large-scale computation for solution. Hence the approach involves to a significant degree large-scale simulations on supercomputers, in addition to analytical modeling. The key tool will be our robust and well-tested Illinois general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. The simulations solve Einstein's field equations of GR for gravity coupled to the equations of relativistic MHD for the fluid and Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields. These equations constitute highly nonlinear, coupled partial differential equations in 3+1 dimensions that we solve by finite-differencing. The Illinois GRMHD code employs the BSSN technique with moving puncture gauge conditions to solve the field equations and a high-resolution, shock capturing scheme for the MHD. The problems to be tackled comprise both initial value and evolution computations and treat vacuum spacetimes containing black holes, as well as spacetimes containing realistic matter sources, magnetic fields and both electromagnetic and neutrino radiation (""multimessenger astronomy"")."

A revolutionary prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity is that accelerated bodies produce gravitational waves, analogous to the way electric charges produce electromagnetic waves. At present, gravitational waves have only been detected indirectly by the way they deplete energy from co-orbiting pulsars. A Laser Interferometric Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO) has been constructed that is expected to open up a new form of astronomy by direct detection of these waves. The most powerful source of gravitational waves is the inspiral and merger of two co-orbiting black holes. Computer simulations provide the theoretical details necessary for LIGO to tune in the gravitational signal and monitor the dynamics of the merger. Einstein's equations describe the production of gravitational waves but their complexity makes a purely analytic approach inadequate. This has necessitated the introduction of computational methods into general relativity.  The project's goal is to develop advanced methods to simulate the production of gravitational waves from black holes.<br/><br/>The approach uses techniques for solving Einstein's equations which have been developed in collaboration with computational mathematicians, thoroughly calibrated on test problems and implemented as a community resource in the Einstein toolkit. The techniques will be further developed to measure the loss of energy and angular momentum carried off by gravitational waves, and other physical properties of binary black hole inspirals, such as the electromagnetic radiation counterpart. The approach utilizes characteristic evolution based upon the light cones on which the radiation  propagates. Most computational work is based upon time evolution using the Cauchy initial value problem. The reformulation of the initial value problem for general relativity in terms of light cones by Bondi and by Penrose resulted in the first clear understanding of gravitational radiation. The global strategy proposed here combines Cauchy evolution in the interior region containing the black holes with characteristic evolution in the exterior region extending along the light cones to infinity. Characteristic evolution led to the first 3-dimensional code which could successfully locate, track, evolve and compute the waveform for a single distorted, spinning and moving black hole. However, in a binary problem, the focusing of the light cones leads to interior caustics which prevent a purely characteristic approach. On the other hand, present Cauchy codes require a finite artificial outer boundary which introduces inefficiency and errors in extracting the waveform. The proposed work  integrates the complementary strengths of Cauchy and characteristic evolution to provide an accurate global treatment."

One of the key missions of LIGO is to test Einstein's theory of General Relativity where it has never been tested before: where the gravitational force is enormous relative to Earth's or the Sun's pull. Such a task is achievable because gravitational waves encode information about this force when black holes and neutron stars collide in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. This project has 2 main goals: (i) to calculate accurate waveforms that aid in the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals and (ii) to develop the best, generic and model-independent framework to test Einstein's theory and search for anomalous deviations in gravitational wave data. <br/><br/>The research described above is creative and potentially transformative, constituting one of the first dedicated efforts to test Einstein's theory with gravitational waves, an essential step to exploit the full potential of gravitational wave detection. This type of research is also timely and relevant, in view of upcoming, advanced detectors and the dawn of gravitational wave astrophysics. The impact of gravitational waves signaling a systematic departure from Einstein's predictions is clearly breathtaking. But the lack of a departure from Einstein's theory would also constitute a huge step for Science, proving for once and for all that Einstein's theory is also valid in the most extreme gravitational scenarios. We also have an ambitious outreach plan that includes the organization of ""Celebrating Einstein"": an immersive art exhibit that incorporates gravitational waves sounds and simulations, orchestra and dance performances, and a scientific workshop. There will be accompanying talks for the public and lectures for local middle school students. Another outreach initiative is the creation of a ""Cosmic Caf"" in Bozeman, Montana, that will reagularly organize activities such as Jeopardy-type contests about Physics."

The research in this project is aimed at simulating on the computer what is expected to be one of the most important sources of gravitational radiation, namely binary systems consisting of black holes. The black holes in such systems spiral towards each other until they form a larger merged black hole. The plan for this project is to investigate these systems in order to make predictions about the gravitational waves emitted during their inspiral and merger. In the course of this work, several key physics questions will be addressed: (i) What is the maximum possible recoil velocity after the two black holes have merged? (ii) For what configurations can spin flips occur? (iii) What is the maximum achievable angular momentum of the final merged black hole?

As with the past research supported by ongoing NSF grants, these results are likely to feature as highlights in interdisciplinary conferences, enhancing communication between diverse communities. Research funded by this grant will also add to human resources in STEM disciplines since post-docs and students will acquire diverse skills, including advanced computational and modeling techniques.<br/><br/>Research  supported  by this grant will cover the following main themes: (i) Gravitational waves. Recent discoveries at LIGO have opened a brand new window on the universe.  The first set of projects in the proposed research will lay down foundations for production and propagation of gravitational waves in the realistic context of the accelerating universe with dark energy, which we inhabit. (ii) A second set of projects will focus on quantum mechanical properties of black holes. In the classical world of general relativity, black holes are sinks of matter, energy and information. But they evaporate through emission of quantum radiation. There is a general agreement that energy is conserved in this process but there has been an ongoing debate on whether information is still lost, or if it is fully encoded in the quantum radiation that is emitted. Previous work supported by this ongoing NSF grant strongly suggests that quantum gravity effects will  remove the `singularity' at the center of the black hole, thereby clearing the way for information --that appeared to be lost there-- to come out.  Details of this process will be worked out. (iii) The third project involves the very early universe. In the currently accepted cosmological paradigms, quantum physics is indispensable in the very early phase of the universe, and yet, soon thereafter it is customary to assume that the universe behaves classically, as in general relativity.  How this classical behavior can emerge, and why all the subtleties and intricacies of quantum physics can be ignored, are issues of great interest both for foundational reasons and for bridging theory with observations. They will be addressed using a combination of methods from quantum field theory in curved space-times, equations governing dynamics of the early universe and geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. (iv) All three projects discussed above are of deep interest to researchers working at the interface of philosophy and frontiers of physical science, particularly general relativity, cosmology and quantum physics.  The results will be discussed at conferences and workshops in these fields, and serve to train young scientists and philosophers in both disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To understand this unprecedented wealth of observational evidence, theoretical calculations are required in order to link data with underlying physics.  However, these demand the creation of new computational tools that can handle an increasingly wide range of physical treatments, characteristic scales, and levels of complexity. The main thrust of this project is to develop some of these tools.<br/><br/>The principal goals supported by this award are to introduce two new techniques into the repertory of physicists and astrophysicists studying strong-field gravity: multipatch methods and regularized spherical coordinates.  The former is an infrastructure to permit efficient computation of heterogeneous systems involving multiple kinds of physics, multiple length scales, and multiple reference frames. The latter is a way to systematically remove from partial differential equations the singularity ordinarily arising at the polar axis. We expect both will be of great value to studies of astrophysical objects in dynamical spacetimes.  To make this introduction, we will generalize our multipatch infrastructure to make it freely compatible with many codes, including Athena++, The Einstein Toolkit, and Harm3D; we will introduce regularized spherical coordinates into the numerical relativity and MHD solvers of both the Einstein Toolkit and the widely used relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code Harm3D; and we will demonstrate the results on selected science problems. With Advanced LIGO now fully operational and the detection of additional gravitational wave events imminent, we expect that there will be a surge in the number of researchers interested in performing simulations of compact binary mergers.   Our new curvilinear and multipatch frameworks will greatly improve the efficiency and ease with which such simulations may be carried out, thereby improving the accuracy of the predictions made for all the messengers---gravitational waves, photons, and neutrinos---of multi-messenger astronomy."

The aim of Einstein@Home is to discover new neutron stars, using gravitational wave data from the advanced LIGO and Virgo observatories, gamma-ray data from the Fermi Satellite, and radio data from the Arecibo Observatory and other radio telescopes. Neutron stars, the targets of this search, are extreme objects formed in supernova explosions. Although they are only about ten miles in diameter, they are more massive than the Sun. So far, most neutron stars have been discovered via pulsations that occur when their beamed electromagnetic emission regularly sweeps past the earth. However, while it is believed that the Milky Way contains about a hundred million neutron stars, fewer than 3000 have been detected so far. Gravitational waves might well be the only way to unveil this invisible population of extreme objects. A project run by the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee has three goals to use Einstein@Home to (1) Make the first direct detection of gravitational waves from spinning neutron stars, and thus to observe these stars via a completely different physical mechanism, which would carry important new information about their internal structure and composition. (2) Make use of new high-frequency radio data from the MeerKAT telescope array in South Africa to discover neutron stars near the Galactic center. These would give the community a way to study the supermassive black hole that resides there, as well as the dense and active region around it. (3) Use gamma-ray data to identify radio-quiet millisecond gamma-ray pulsars, providing new evidence about the evolution and emission of pulsars. Einstein@Home is an outstanding public outreach effort, allowing people world-wide to contribute directly to exciting and cutting-edge scientific research.<br/><br/>Since it began, Einstein@Home volunteers have donated more than 3 billion CPU-core hours of computing time to the project.

This award also funds the continued operations and further development of Einstein@Home, including maintenance and administration of the central hardware and software infrastructure, the handling and post-processing of LIGO, Virgo, Fermi and radio data, and the design and implementation of improved search methods.  The detection of continuous gravitational waves will provide glimpses into the invisible population of neutron stars that inhabits our Galaxy and shed light on their internal structure and evolutionary history. The discovery of new neutron stars in short period binaries and near the Galactic center will improve our understanding of stellar evolution and populations, help study the black hole at the Galactic center, and provide stringent tests of general relativity. Discovery of new millisecond radio pulsars will improve the ability of ""pulsar timing arrays"" to detect low-frequency gravitational waves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This encompasses both astrophysical and theoretical aspects of general relativity. On the astrophysical side, the main effort is numerical simulations of binary black hole, black hole-neutron star and binary neutron star collisions. This is important to support the field of gravitational wave astronomy recently ushered in by LIGO's detection of the collision of two black holes. Numerical models of such sources are needed to aid in detection, and are crucial to decipher details of observed signals. On the theoretical side, there are many outstanding questions about the nature of spacetime in extreme situations. The one that will be the main focus here is the ultra-relativistic limit of black hole collisions; namely, what happens when two black holes collide at the speed of light. Speculation about the outcome began in the 1960's when Penrose used this scenario to help formulate his cosmic censorship conjecture, stating all singularities in spacetime are hidden behind event horizons. Numerical methods are now giving us the tools to definitively tackle this regime of general relativity. The pursuit of these projects will involve graduate students, undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows. They will be trained to do leading scientific research, become knowledgeable in corresponding areas of physics, and adept in high-performance computing and numerical methods. These skills are invaluable to many professions, and would thus also benefit and further the development of those students and postdocs that subsequently wish to pursue careers outside academia.<br/><br/>A specific list of gravitational wave source modeling projects that will be pursued are (1) understanding the consequences of neutron star spin in binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, (2) improving estimates of heavy element yields and corresponding electromagnetic counterpart emission in collisions involving neutron stars when there is significant ejected material, (3) beginning to include neutrino and radiation transport, and improving our models of magnetic fields in our evolution code, relevant for mergers involving neutron stars, (4) continued development of the parameterized post Einsteinian (ppE) framework for eccentric binaries to allow such events, if observed, to be used to test general relativity, and (5) explore binary mergers in alternative theories of gravity and/or exotic alternatives to black holes within general relativity (such as boson stars), to allow the merger event recently detected by LIGO and future detections to constrain/rule-out/discover these alternatives. Regarding the ultra-relativistic collision problem, the route to approaching this limit will be by developing a code to study the collision of distributions of null dust. Such distributions can be tailored to approach both the point-particle and plane-parallel wave collision limits in a non-singular manner amenable to full numerical treatment."

Questions to be explored include how often these sources happen, how we might detect them (both in gravitational waves and electromagnetically), and what we will learn from them. Light will be shed on the inner engines of gamma-ray bursts (among the brightest events in the Universe), including elucidating the heart of these events (are they neutron star black hole binaries?) and the processes by which they happen (are the gamma-rays beamed?). In this way, the scientific potential of gravitational-wave astrophysics will be more fully realized.<br/><br/>Gravitational waves are likely to be directly observed within the next five years, and will open an entirely new window on the Universe. We already see the Universe in optical light (e.g., with our eyes, or with the Hubble Space Telescope), in X-ray, in gamma-rays, in radio, in microwave, and across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Gravitational waves offer an entirely new way to the listen to the Universe. We've been searching for these waves for many decades, and within the next five years the LIGO instrument (based in Washington and Louisiana) will finally allow us to hear them! Fully exploiting this new window on the Universe will require multi-messenger astronomy: coordinated observations of sources in both the gravitational wave and electromagnetic spectra. This work will help develop our understanding of these multi-messenger sources.  Gravitational-waves provide a natural ""hook"" into science, and are an excellent way to appeal to students of all ages. The history of gravitational waves is irresistible, with Einstein's original (and contentious) prediction finally on the verge of being directly confirmed. The waves are generated by black holes and gamma-ray bursts (representing some of the largest explosions in the Universe), and these sources are universally fascinating. The technology behind gravitational-wave detection is mind-blowing (""You can detect the surf crashing on the Oregon coast hundreds of miles away"", ""You can measure fractional changes in distance over 4 km to much smaller than the size of a proton""). The science content ranges from wave mechanics, through Newtonian gravity, interferometry, and wave optics, all the way to general relativity and quantum measurement. In short, we have a rich, timely, and fundamentally fascinating subject. We take a multi-pronged approach to share the excitement of the impending discovery of gravitational-waves, as well as to convey the science behind our research program to students and the broader public. We work directly with inner-city, minority high-school students in the South Chicago area. We are also partnering with a world-class museum, the Adler Planetarium, by presenting at the museum and helping to develop material on gravitational waves that will reach nearly half a million people a year, as well as leveraging existing educational material from LIGO. All of this will help share the excitement of a truly new way to listen to the Universe."

A major  emphasis will be on the  modeling of   thin structures (plates and shells). Specifically, an innovative  new finite   element method recently proposed by a team of computational  engineers for   plate bending will be analyzed and a new approach the  investigator   introduced in collaboration with Brezzi to develop and analyze  new finite   element methods for modeling the deformation of elastic shells  will be   pursued.  This latter approach has produced the best theoretical  results to   date for avoiding the phenomenon known as membrane locking which  has   plagued shell computations.  In addition to studying numerical  methods and   the errors they introduce, the investigator will consider the  errors introduced   by mathematical models of thin structures.  Specifically, a new  technique of   analysis to study the convergence of two-dimensional models of  thin plates   will be used.  This technique gives the possibility of obtaining  sharp   convergence estimates for plate modeling errors both globally and  away   from the lateral boundary (where convergence may be higher).  It  is hoped   that this research will clarify in what situations the  Reissner-Mindlin plate   model affords better approximation than the classical Kirchhoff  model, an   important question that eluded resolution for decades.  A second  area of   emphasis will be on the  development, implementation, validation,  and   dissemination of a finite element code to simulate the collision  of black   holes.  This problem involves the solution of the Einstein field  equations on   an unbounded domain in four dimensional space-time and is  extremely   demanding computationally.  Work will focus, at least initially,  on the   solution of the initial data problem for black hole collisions,  i.e., the   determination of physical ly consistent and meaningful initial  data. The   initial data problem is a nonlinear elliptic system posed on an  unbounded   three-dimensional domain.  For this problem the computer code to  be   produced will involve a variety of sophisticated modern  techniques that   have not yet been applied in  computational relativity, including  adaptive   tetrahedral mesh generation and multigrid preconditioning.    The investigator's work is directly related to several critical  technological   issues.  It is generally agreed by practitioners that the current  state of the art   of numerical modeling of shells is inadequate, and this has been  implicated   in the failure of engineering structures such as stadium roofs  and airplane   fuselages.  The investigator's work in both the area of the  development and   analysis of finite element methods for plates and shells, and on  plate   modeling errors is directed at overcoming these problems.  The  work on the   simulation of black hole collisions is directly motivated by the  ongoing   construction of the LIGO gravitational wave observatory.  LIGO is  expected   to be able to detect radiation from black hole collisions early  in the next   decade.  Massive numerical simulations are needed to identify the    cosmological events which are the sources for the detected  radiation. It is   clear that these simulations push the limits of available  hardware and   software technology.  The investigator's work is directed at  improving the   speed and accuracy of these  simulations by employing and  adapting recent   advances in numerical algorithms.  The resulting computer codes  will be   adapted to parallel computer architectures and will provide an  excellent   opportunity for the graduate students and postdoctoral fellows  working   under the supervision of the investigator to learn high  performance   computing techniques."

There is broad consensus in the scientific community that LIGO will soon detect gravitational waves from numerous neutron stars in our Galaxy, which were first observed by radio pulses in the 1960s. Unlike radio waves however, gravitational waves carry information about the interior of neutron stars, which will reveal new insight into nuclear physics at high density and temperature. This project is focused on improving the odds of detecting the gravitational waves from neutron stars by constructing accurate mathematical models of neutron stars and the signals they emit. Integrating nuclear physics and astrophysics, the PI will use modern computational algorithms to estimate key parameters that affect the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by neutron stars. Results from this research will reduce the computational cost of searching for gravitational wave signals, refine existing models of nuclear physics, and train several graduate students from CSU Long Beach in the methods of scientific research.<br/><br/>In this project, the PI will calculate the non-radial oscillation modes of compact stars made in part or entirely of strange quark matter and will study their relevance to gravitational wave signatures. The goal is to discover trends in the mode spectrum that can be used as gravitational wave fingerprints of the inner structure of neutron stars. Using theoretical principles of fluid dynamics and general relativity, supplemented by numerical routines, this research will advance the understanding of nuclear physics at high density and its implications for compact star oscillations. Novel aspects of this research include investigating the impact of composition gradients, superfluidity, and mixed phases in quark matter on the oscillation spectrum of multi-component strange/hybrid stars. The proposed methods for this research involve numerical coding to solve coupled equations of fluid dynamics in strongly gravitating spacetime inside compact stars. Through these tasks, this project will help quantify the non-radial oscillation modes for realistic quark matter equations of state, identify robust and model-dependent features of the oscillation spectrum and propose distinguishing features between neutron stars and strange stars that can be tested by gravitational wave detectors."

MMA was galvanized when the collision of two neutron stars (labeled GW/GRB 170817A) was detected last year by multiple large science instruments including the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), its sister gravitational wave observatory VIRGO in Italy, NASA's Fermi gamma-ray telescope in space, and many other optical and radio telescopes world-wide. These multiple measurements of just one event improved our estimate of the speed of gravity to phenomenal precision, confirmed that neutron star mergers are the origin of the heavier atomic elements, and gave us a measurement of the radii of neutron stars to about one kilometer accuracy. Over the next decade, LIGO will identify dozens of such events per year. In parallel, the NSF-supported IceCube neutrino observatory at the U.S. South Pole Station and other neutrino and cosmic ray observatories are detecting high-energy cosmic rays from distant cosmological sources; and the new NSF-led Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and upcoming radio astronomy facilities will come online to survey the skies with unprecedented speed and depth throughout the Universe. While each kind of astronomical observing system will bring fascinating new discoveries, it is in their combination - through MMA - that transformative new insights into some of the most fundamental questions about the Universe can be realized: What is the nature of the highest-energy cosmic particle accelerators? What are the properties of cold and hot bulk matter at supra-nuclear densities? How do black holes form and evolve, across their full range of masses, and throughout cosmic time?<br/> <br/>The promise of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics can be realized only if sufficient cyberinfrastructure is available to rapidly handle, combine, and analyze the very large-scale distributed data from all the types of astronomical measurements. This project seeks to carry out community planning for scalable cyberinfrastructure to support MMA. The primary goal is to identify the key questions and cyberinfrastructure projects required by the community to take full advantage of the substantial investments in current facilities, and to realize the enormous potential of the multiple imminent next-generation projects over the decade to come. Two products of the project will be: 1) a community white paper that presents an in-depth analysis of the cyberinfrastructure needs and the opportunities for collaborations among astronomers, computer scientists, and data scientists; and 2) a strategic plan for a scalable cyberinfrastructure institute for multi-messenger astrophysics laying out its proposed mission, identifying the highest priority areas for cyberinfrastructure research and development for the US-based multi-messenger astrophysics community, and presenting a strategy for managing and evolving a set of services that benefits and engages the entire community.<br/> <br/>This project advances the objectives of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) and the objectives of ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" and ""Windows on the Universe, two of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.<br/> <br/>This project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical & Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to detect and characterize the gravitational-wave signals observed by Advanced LIGO, theoretical models that predict the detailed behavior of the signal as a function of the source parameters are required. These models must provide an accurate approximation to the exact solution of Einstein's equations, but must also be rapidly and robustly calculable, so that they can be used to predict the signal at hundreds of millions of parameter locations in order to characterize a single event. To that end, this project will create a new state-of-the-art in accurate and efficient waveform models, thus helping to ensure that future Advanced LIGO observations are not limited by the waveform models being used. In addition to the scientific benefits, this work will result in the training of a graduate student in the best practices of analytical relativity and gravitational-wave data analysis, thereby helping to train the next generation of gravitational-wave astronomers. Finally, this proposal will help facilitate impactful education and outreach throughout the state of West Virginia, by contributing to the existing Space Public Outreach Team (SPOT) program through the development of a new presentation on gravitational-wave astrophysics.<br/><br/>The Precessing Spinning Effective-One-Body Numerical-Relativity (SEOBNRv3, and SEOBNRv4P currently under development) gravitational waveform model is one of only two models (along with IMRPhenomP) capable of facilitating complete parameter estimation (PE) of black-hole binary events. However, despite their great efficiency and reliability when compared to numerical relativity waveforms, the original SEOBNR codes were still far too slow to be directly useful for standard Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based PE. To address this issue, the PI's team previously developed optimized versions of the SEOBNR approximants, which make it possible, using SEOBNRv3_opt, to perform PE on a candidate event at a much faster rate. In addition, the development of SEOBNRv3_opt uncovered occasional pathological behavior in the underlying SEOBNRv3 approximant. While only occurring in one out of every ~10,000 to 100,000 cases, this frequency nonetheless presents a major obstacle to PE, which requires the generation of 10^8 waveform realizations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an approximant that is both significantly more efficient than SEOBNRv3_opt, and also substantially more robust. This project will create a new state-of-the-art approximant that is both more accurate and more robust than any currently in existence. This will require, first, the creation of a new approximant based on SEOBNRv3_opt, but replacing the ringdown attachment with the Backwards One-Body (BOB) merger-ringdown model developed by the PI, which produces merger-ringdown waveforms as accurate as NR results across the entire range of parameter space probed by NR. Because BOB can be extended to earlier times than the light ring, it can avoid the extreme sensitivity of SEOBNRv3 to the exact light ring location, thereby dramatically improving the robustness of the model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Problems with security credentials (e.g., expiration, privilege mismatch) cause the workflows to fail to fetch needed input data or store valuable scientific results, distracting scientists from their research by requiring them to diagnose the problems, re-run their computations, and wait longer for their results. In an effort to avoid these problems, scientists often use long-lived, highly-privileged credentials (e.g., enabling the workflow to fully impersonate their identity), increasing risks to their accounts and to the underlying computational infrastructure and resulting in complexity for information security officers managing the infrastructure. The SciTokens project delivers open source software to help scientists manage their security credentials more reliably and securely. The project includes participants from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project to ensure relevance and facilitate adoption. Integration with the widely-used HTCondor software and collaboration with Open Science Grid and the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) facilitates adoption by the wider scientific community.<br/><br/>To address the challenges and risks of managing security credentials for scientific workflows, the SciTokens project delivers an open source software infrastructure that uses IETF-standard Open Authorization (OAuth) tokens for capability-based secure access to remote scientific data. SciTokens uses OAuth refresh tokens, maintained securely on the submission node, to delegate short-lived, least-privilege OAuth access tokens to scientific workflows, to enable their remote data access. The access tokens convey the specific authorizations needed by the workflows, rather than general-purpose authentication impersonation credentials. These least-privilege authorization tokens help to address the risks of scientific workflows running on distributed infrastructure including NSF resources (e.g., LIGO Data Grid, Open Science Grid, XSEDE) and public clouds (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure). By improving the interoperability and security of scientific workflows, the SciTokens project 1) enables use of distributed computing for scientific domains that require greater data protection and 2) enables use of more widely distributed computing resources by reducing the risk of credential abuse on remote systems."

This process can be tedious and error-prone, which has led to the development of software known as a ""workflow management system"". Workflow management systems allow scientists to describe their process in a human-friendly way and then the software handles the details of the processing for the scientists, dealing with tedious and repetitive steps and handling errors. One popular workflow management system is Pegasus, which, over the past three years, was used to run over 700,000 workflows by scientists in a number of domains including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, gravitational wave physics, ocean science, and neuroscience. The ""Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus"" project enhances Pegasus with additional security features. The scientist's description of their desired work is protected from tampering and the data processed by Pegasus is checked to ensure it hasn't been accidentally or maliciously modified. Such tamper protection is attained by cryptographic techniques that ensure data integrity. These changes allow scientists, and our society, to be more confident of scientific findings based on collected data.<br/><br/>The Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus project strengthens cybersecurity controls in the Pegasus Workflow Management System in order to provide assurances with respect to the integrity of computational scientific methods. These strengthened controls enhance both Pegasus' handling of science data and its orchestration of software-defined networks and infrastructure. The result is increased trust in computational science and increased assurance in our ability to reproduce the science by allowing scientists to validate that data has not been changed since a workflow completed and that the results from multiple workflows are consistent. The focus on Pegasus is due to its popularity in the scientific community as a method of computation and data management automation. For example, LIGO, the NSF-funded gravitational-wave physics project, recently used the Pegasus Workflow Management System to structure and execute the analyses that confirmed and quantified its historic detection of a gravitational wave, confirming the prediction made by Einstein 100 years ago. The proposed project has established collaborations with LIGO and additional key NSF infrastructure providers and science projects to ensure broadly applied results."

The goal of better image quality is feedback into the additive manufacturing print parameters so as to increase part yield and reliability. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be the first to commercialize high-energy, X-ray grating interferometry in the US.  The interferometry concepts for this proposal are novel and have been partly derived from the NSF-supported gravity wave detection facility, the Laser Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), which led to a hardware/software patent for high-energy X-ray grating optics and software. The microfabricated gold and/or nickel structures on silicon or graphite wafers have exceedingly high aspect ratios, requiring the use of support structures for physical stability of the microfabricated features.  The support structures introduce image noise and diminished interferometry performance.  The LIGO-derived procedure accommodates the support structures, restoring image quality and instrument performance.  The support structures are especially important for optics used with high-energy X-rays, such as systems designed for inspection of additive manufacturing metal components<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Planned upgrades to Advanced LIGO, in addition to planned future generations of international gravitational wave observatories, will seek to extend the range of the detectors and enable further discoveries within gravitational wave astronomy. However, all future detector upgrades and concepts rely on the development of new mirror coating materials to reduce thermal noise.

This research program will significantly enhance our ability to collect atomic structure data at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) in collaboration with SSRL scientists, and will accelerate our ability to find coating materials with lower thermal noise. <br/><br/>Recent progress in determining lower thermal noise coatings has been realized from the determination of the atomic structure of amorphous oxide films through X-ray scattering methods at SSRL.

The proposed program addresses the opportunity to develop, in conjunction with collaborators at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, an improved beamline at SSRL and with it initiate high-throughput Grazing-Incidence X-ray Pair Distribution Function (GIPDF) measurements to speed the rate at which we can recover structural information on new coating materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scale of this task far outpaces our current ability to manage and process data in a distributed environment, demanding fundamental IT advances.<br/><br/>To meet these challenges, GriPhyN will pursue an aggressive program of IT research to realize the concept of Virtual Data. This encompasses the definition and delivery of a (potentially unlimited) virtual space of data products derived from experimental data. In this virtual data space, requests can be satisfied by direct access and/or by computation, depending on the requirements of local and global resource management and security policies.

In the process, it will create PVDG systems for community use. This will educate a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists with expertise in the critical area of data intensive computing. The benefits of doing so will not be unique to physics, but will also apply to problems in biology (e.g. the human genome project), the environment (e.g. the Earth Observation System), and many other areas.<br/>"

In atomic force microscopes (AFM), for example, lasers are used to read out the position of a microscopic cantilever scanning over a surface, with sufficient precision to measure surface variations on the sub-nanometer scale (less than a thousandth of a millionth of a meter--9 zeros past the decimal place).  On a completely different size scale, laser light is used to read out the positions of kilogram-scale mirrors of interferometric gravitational wave (GW) detectors with sub-attometer precision (less than a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a meter--18 zeros past the decimal place). Even though these devices occupy very different scales, they are united by similar principles and limitations to precision position measurement. AFM cantilevers, the mirrors of GW detectors, and indeed a large variety of other mechanical oscillators used as tools of quantum information science, as time keepers, as frequency standards, or as other precision sensors have one thing in common. They all seek to operate at the best precision that quantum mechanics allows. When using laser light to measure the position of a mechanical object, the quantum fluctuations of the light, arising from the discrete nature of photons, imposes a limit on how well one can do. This work explores these quantum limits to position measurement in laboratory experiments that span micro-gram to gram scale mechanical oscillators, with the goal of developing techniques for improving position measurements in general, but also with specific applications to GW detectors.<br/> <br/>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) seeks to detect GWs emitted by violent cosmic events such as supernova explosions and collisions of neutron stars and black holes. Since GWs are completely distinct from electromagnetic radiation, direct detection of GWs is expected to open a new window into the Universe and provide opportunities to study cosmic phenomena that are ""invisible"" using light alone. GWs from astrophysical sources cause microscopic distortions of spacetime that can be measured by an interferometer whose mirrors are suspended as pendulums to isolate them from all other effects beside the GW. The changes in arm length, typically of order 1e-19 meters (1/10000 the size of a proton!), are detected by very precise measurement of the interference pattern of the laser light reflected from each 4 kilometer long arm of the interferometer. Quantum fluctuations of the light arising from the discrete nature of photons limit the sensitivity of GW detectors. The so-called shot noise, due to the random quantum fluctuations of the light, limits the precision with which the interference pattern, and hence the GW signal, can be measured. Similarly, radiation pressure noise limits the sensitivity due to the interferometer mirrors being ""kicked"" by the fluctuating momentum of the photons that is transferred to the mirrors when the laser light reflects from them. The proposed experimental program comprises cavity optomechanics experiments with gram- and micro-gram scale mechanical oscillators are aimed at studying several radiation pressure induced phenomena, including direct observation quantum radiation pressure (backaction) noise that is expected to be a major limiting noise source in Advanced LIGO; observation and manipulation of optomechanically induced transparency; observation of ponderomotive squeezing, a promising alternative for generation of squeezed states of light; ground state cooling of macroscopic objects; and reaching and surpassing the free-particle Standard Quantum Limit, which would allow for direct tests of quantum non-demolition measurement techniques. The main purpose of this research is to further the understanding of optomechanical systems in the quantum regime focusing on the features most relevant to GW detectors. Equally attractive is the prospect of exploring the fundamental physics of quantum correlations due to light-mirror couplings in a macroscopic mechanical oscillator system."

Among the data analysis elements we will create are the streaming data calibration system, a low-latency system for determining data quality and glitch vetoing, and on-line searches for signals from inspiralling compact binaries and for generic unmodeled bursts. Such a system to rapidly identify signals will be an essential element of gravitational wave science in the Advanced Detector Era, and will enable multi-messenger astronomy in which observations of several kinds (gravitational waves; electromagnetic waves; high energy particles) are synthesized to obtain a detailed understanding of the sources of the most cataclysmic events in the universe. Gravitational wave astronomy will reveal the inner mechanism of the mysterious gamma ray bursts, will provide a means to measure the population of black holes and determine the channel by which massive black holes are grown, and will probe the fundamental nature of matter above nuclear densities. New ways of measuring cosmological parameters will become available, which will complement existing observations. Gravitational wave observations will also provide sensitive tests of Einstein's General Relativity in ways in which it has not yet been scrutinized. The opening of the gravitational wave window onto the universe can potentially evince exotic objects such as naked singularities, cosmic strings, or unexpected physics. We must be ready to address these scientific challenges as our new astronomical facilities come into operation. To this end, this award will support work that may result in the first gravitational wave discoveries of compact binary coalescence, provide rapid sky localization to facilitate electromagnetic follow-up efforts, yield fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities, obtain the the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger, observe black hole formation channels and probe fundamental properties of black holes through their quasi-normal modes of oscillation, scan the sky to find undiscovered rapidly rotating neutron stars and to learn about their properties, test cherished principles of gravitation such as the no-hair and cosmic-censorship conjectures, and seek new exotic and unexpected phenomena.<br/><br/>Our work supports the creation of critical components of a system that will allow the rapid transmittal of gravitational wave observations to the entire community of astronomers, and facilitates the integration of gravitational wave science into the broader field of astrophysics. The group has a solid track record of educating new researchers; this project will have a broad impact by training a new generation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty members in gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as conveying the excitement of this budding branch of astronomy to the community through outreach efforts such as the UWM Planetarium."

Among the key predictions of the theory, which includes the expanding Universe and the existence of black holes, is the existence of gravitational waves (GW): ripples moving at the speed of light in the geometry of space-time caused by the fast motion of large masses. Although well tested in terms of their indirect effects on binary systems of compact stars, the direct detection of gravitational waves incident on Earth poses an outstanding challenge. The scientific rewards from achieving this ability would be enormous - ranging from probing the extreme dynamics of exploding stars to gleaning information about the state of the Universe almost at the moment of the Big Bang itself. The effort to enable this new window on the universe has occupied several decades of experimental and technological developments that have pushed the boundaries across diverse fields in the physical sciences. The year 2015 will mark a highly-anticipated watershed moment for gravitational-wave physics: The two advanced Laser Interferomenter Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) detectors will start their initial data taking runs, followed by the commissioning of the advanced Virgo gravitational wave observatory in Europe. The sensitivity of the aLIGO detector will be ramped up to become about ten times better than that of the first-generation detectors, opening up a spatial volume for observing GW sources that will be 1000 times larger than before. This award supports the first searches of Advanced LIGO data for gravitational waves from the youngest neutron stars in the galaxy.  As they spin down over the years, these stars can tell us about the properties of matter under the most extreme conditions since the Big Bang: supernuclear densities, relativistic speeds, superconducting and superfluid at a hundred million degrees.  One day they may also be used to test whether Einstein's general theory of relativity is the correct description of gravity at astrophysical scales.<br/><br/>The bulk of the work involves the upgrade and implementation of a data analysis code pipeline to perform matched filtering searches for continuous gravitational waves from young supernova remnants.  Improvements in the code and data will allow more sensitive searches than ever before.  This code will also be adapted for the purpose of detector characterization to assist with improving the LIGO interferometers' performance over the course of their first science run, particularly with regard to narrow-band spectral artifacts."

This includes torsion pendulums used for measurements of the equivalence principle and the gravitational inverse-square law, investigations of macroscopic quantum mechanical oscillators, cryogenic sapphire oscillators for use in the timing of pulsars for radio astronomy, the pendulums and mirrors of laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors, and reference cavities in atomic clocks and spectroscopy. For example, the large scale interferometers which are now being built in the U.S. as part of the Advanced LIGO project, will have an unprecedented sensitivity to gravitational waves from violent astrophysical phenomena but are limited in their sensitivity by thermal noise in their optical coatings. In the future, making further dramatic improvements in the astrophysical reach of gravitational wave detectors will require reducing the thermal noise in the interferometers mirrors. This Brownian motion of the mirror surface also limits the achievable frequency stability of modern stabilized lasers. These lasers are stabilized to rigid Fabry-Perot resonator cavities with mirrors very similar to those in the LIGO interferometers. The best atomic clocks today are limited by the frequency fluctuations of the lasers used to interrogate them. Improving the stability of the optical cavities would allow researchers to push the stability of the atomic clocks by orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>This EAGER award supports preliminary research aimed at making more than an order of magnitude improvement in the line-widths of these reference cavities by attempting to use, for the first time, cryogenic silicon as an optical reference cavity. Since the thermal energy in the mirrors and their coatings is proportional to temperature, there could be a direct improvement by going to low temperature although the noise in such a cavity has never been measured.  The scheme to be used is untested and an unanticipated noise source may be uncovered. However, the potential benefits which can be reaped by using high quality, cryogenic materials are tremendous and would have far reaching, possibly transformative, repercussions in leading edge physics measurements.<br/><br/>An ultra-stable laser wavelength is an essential tool in a variety of fields including gravitational-wave detection, atomic clocks, and tests of General Relativity. The stability of the laser wavelength is important enough in these fields to have stimulated a long program of research in constructing increasingly stable reference cavities. In addition to understanding the thermal noise behavior at low temperatures, this research could eventually produce a new level of frequency stability for lasers and precision for atomic clocks."

Data analysis strategies for searching GW signals from a variety of astrophysical and cosmological sources with a network of detectors operating simultaneously will be formulated as part of this program.

Sophomores and seniors, numbering about 200 per year, will be trained to develop skills in a field that will soon be inundated with data, with the hope that some of them will go on to graduate programs strongly tied to GW research. Courses in GW science will be cross-listed towards a major in physics, thus expanding their impact. LIGO will be supported by this work in ushering in a new era in Physics and Astronomy where novel insights will be gained into the behavior of pulsars, supernovae and black holes, and in putting our best understanding of classical gravity, in the form of Einstein's general relativity, to a fresh set of stringent tests."

MMA was galvanized when the collision of two neutron stars (labeled GW/GRB 170817A) was detected last year by multiple large science instruments including the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), its sister gravitational wave observatory VIRGO in Italy, NASA's Fermi gamma-ray telescope in space, and many other optical and radio telescopes world-wide. These multiple measurements of just one event improved our estimate of the speed of gravity to phenomenal precision, confirmed that neutron star mergers are the origin of the heavier atomic elements, and gave us a measurement of the radii of neutron stars to about one kilometer accuracy. Over the next decade, LIGO will identify dozens of such events per year. In parallel, the NSF-supported IceCube neutrino observatory at the U.S. South Pole Station and other neutrino and cosmic ray observatories are detecting high-energy cosmic rays from distant cosmological sources; and the new NSF-led Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and upcoming radio astronomy facilities will come online to survey the skies with unprecedented speed and depth throughout the Universe. While each kind of astronomical observing system will bring fascinating new discoveries, it is in their combination - through MMA - that transformative new insights into some of the most fundamental questions about the Universe can be realized: What is the nature of the highest-energy cosmic particle accelerators? What are the properties of cold and hot bulk matter at supra-nuclear densities? How do black holes form and evolve, across their full range of masses, and throughout cosmic time?<br/> <br/>The promise of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics can be realized only if sufficient cyberinfrastructure is available to rapidly handle, combine, and analyze the very large-scale distributed data from all the types of astronomical measurements. This project seeks to carry out community planning for scalable cyberinfrastructure to support MMA. The primary goal is to identify the key questions and cyberinfrastructure projects required by the community to take full advantage of the substantial investments in current facilities, and to realize the enormous potential of the multiple imminent next-generation projects over the decade to come. Two products of the project will be: 1) a community white paper that presents an in-depth analysis of the cyberinfrastructure needs and the opportunities for collaborations among astronomers, computer scientists, and data scientists; and 2) a strategic plan for a scalable cyberinfrastructure institute for multi-messenger astrophysics laying out its proposed mission, identifying the highest priority areas for cyberinfrastructure research and development for the US-based multi-messenger astrophysics community, and presenting a strategy for managing and evolving a set of services that benefits and engages the entire community.<br/> <br/>This project advances the objectives of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) and the objectives of ""Harnessing the Data Revolution"" and ""Windows on the Universe, two of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.<br/> <br/>This project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical & Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations of general relativity - called Einstein's equations - are sufficiently complex so that they can be solved exactly only under very special circumstances.  To understand the merger of two black holes, for example, and to predict the signals that we hope to observe soon with the LIGO gravitational wave observatory, requires computer simulations.  This award supports research efforts aimed at developing methods and approaches for such computer simulations.  In particular, the focus is on methods that are well suited for the self-consistent treatment of the gravitational forces in supernova explosions.  These extremely energetic explosions play an important role in the evolution of the universe, even the development of life, lead to the formation of black holes or neutron stars, and yet we still lack a detailed understanding of the explosion mechanism.  <br/><br/>The scientific goals of this research effort in numerical relativity include the development and implementation of numerical algorithms for the solution of Einstein's equations of general relativity, as well as their application in the numerical modeling of relativistic objects, in particular neutron stars and black holes.  The focus of this work is methods in spherical polar coordinates, which have distinct advantages over Cartesian coordinates for many applications, including gravitational collapse, accretion disks, and supernova calculations.  This is done in collaboration with colleagues at the Max-Planck-Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, on including these methods in relativistic astrophysics simulations with a state-of-the-art treatment of microphysical phenomena.  Among the long-term goals are supernova simulations that adopt both these advanced microphysics methods and a self-consistent treatment of relativistic gravitational fields.  These results will advance our understanding of these processes and will predict their observational signatures in neutrino, electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals.  The latter will be important for the new generation of gravitational wave laser interferometers, including the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (LIGO)."

This process can be tedious and error-prone, which has led to the development of software known as a ""workflow management system"". Workflow management systems allow scientists to describe their process in a human-friendly way and then the software handles the details of the processing for the scientists, dealing with tedious and repetitive steps and handling errors. One popular workflow management system is Pegasus, which, over the past three years, was used to run over 700,000 workflows by scientists in a number of domains including astronomy, bioinformatics, earthquake science, gravitational wave physics, ocean science, and neuroscience. The ""Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus"" project enhances Pegasus with additional security features. The scientist's description of their desired work is protected from tampering and the data processed by Pegasus is checked to ensure it hasn't been accidentally or maliciously modified. Such tamper protection is attained by cryptographic techniques that ensure data integrity. These changes allow scientists, and our society, to be more confident of scientific findings based on collected data.<br/><br/>The Scientific Workflow Integrity with Pegasus project strengthens cybersecurity controls in the Pegasus Workflow Management System in order to provide assurances with respect to the integrity of computational scientific methods. These strengthened controls enhance both Pegasus' handling of science data and its orchestration of software-defined networks and infrastructure. The result is increased trust in computational science and increased assurance in our ability to reproduce the science by allowing scientists to validate that data has not been changed since a workflow completed and that the results from multiple workflows are consistent. The focus on Pegasus is due to its popularity in the scientific community as a method of computation and data management automation. For example, LIGO, the NSF-funded gravitational-wave physics project, recently used the Pegasus Workflow Management System to structure and execute the analyses that confirmed and quantified its historic detection of a gravitational wave, confirming the prediction made by Einstein 100 years ago. The proposed project has established collaborations with LIGO and additional key NSF infrastructure providers and science projects to ensure broadly applied results."

Techniques and codes will also be developed for probing the unknown thermal part of the equation of state at nuclear densities by using the gravitational wave and electromagnetic signatures from binary neutron star mergers.  The proposed studies are extremely timely in light of the recent detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations not only as generated by binary black holes, but also as generated by compact binaries with at least one neutron star.

Since we can now detect and study gravitational waves, a new window to the universe has been opened. Observations from a variety of other astrophysical sources are anticipated. One particularly promising source is when two neutron stars orbit around each other and merge. As long as the two compact objects are widely separated, post-Newtonian calculations can give highly accurate and astrophysically realistic predictions about the orbits and the gravitational waves emitted. Yet, as the two objects get close, fully non-linear numerical computer simulations of the Einstein equations are required to make predictions about the final part of the inspiral and subsequent merger. This project is aimed at gaining a detailed understanding of such astrophysical scenarios by performing numerical simulations. The plan is to use and improve the highly efficient BAM computer code, which has been developed by the numerical relativity groups at the University of Jena in Germany and the group at Florida Atlantic University (FAU). Such theoretical predictions of the emitted gravitational waves are important to extract the maximum amount of information from observed gravitational wave signals. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/>Expecting the detection of more gravitational wave signals from black hole binaries and anticipating the detection of binaries containing neutron stars, the goal is to significantly enhance the theoretical understanding of such systems in terms of physics, in particular with regard to neutron star spins. This project proposes to explore astrophysically realistic compact-object binaries. In particular, addressing several key physics issues such as: (i) How does neutron star spin, mass ratio and eccentricity in binaries affect the evolution of the inspiral, the merger, and final object after merger? (ii) Study the gravitational waves emitted by such binaries: Investigate spectra of the waves and create hybrid waveforms using analytic approximations such as the effective-one-body approach. (iii) How can magnetic fields in neutron star initial data be included in a consistent and realistic way? (iv) How can neutron star evolutions be improved by removing the artificial numerical atmosphere, that is currently used instead of true vacuum between the stars? (v) How can we use hyperboloidal foliations to obtain more accurate gravitational waves? By providing gravitational wave templates, the proposed activities are critical for maximizing the science output of gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO. Neutrons star mergers and the resulting disk dynamics will shed light on the question whether such mergers are engines for Gamma Ray Bursts, and help determine the currently unknown equation of state at supranuclear densities. This research will be carried out in close collaboration with the relativity group at the University of Jena led by Dr. Bruegmann. Regular visits by faculty, postdocs and students from both institutions are planned. This exchange will have educational benefits for postdocs and students from both FAU and the University of Jena."

Work in this program so far has done much to clarify how interactions with a black hole's event horizon affect the evolution of compact binaries.  Ongoing work is now probing orbits with substantial spin-orbit misalignment, laying the groundwork for using the EOB framework on a larger family of astrophysically relevant orbits.  The group will also use black hole perturbation theory as the foundation for understanding self forces, computing how a body deforms the spacetime in which it moves and how that deformation acts back upon the body's motion.  In the domain of gravitational wave astronomy, they have begun a systematic investigation into how black hole modes are excited in the final merger of two black holes.  This analysis will allow us to understand how the mixture of modes excited by black holes mergers depends upon the collision geometry and characteristics of the merging black holes.  The analysis will also make it possible to learn more about the characteristics of the merging black holes from the gravitational waves that we measure."

It has long been thought that truly extreme objects such as black holes and neutron stars are responsible.  Advanced instruments spanning the electromagnetic spectrum have provided a wealth of information regarding the transient Universe; however, many observations are unable to directly probe the dynamics of the systems in question.  General relativity provides a way to map out the dynamics of massive, dense objects from a distance by encoding the motion as ripples in space-time known as gravitational waves.  The principal investigator of this project will lead an effort within the LIGO Scientific Collaboration to detect transient gravitational waves from the merger of black holes and neutron stars in real-time, enabling prompt multi-wavelength follow-up observations that can shed new light onto the origin of transients. Discoveries will be relayed to a network of follow-up observatories so that scientists can learn as much as possible about these events before they fade away.  This research will increase understanding of the fundamental nature of space, time and the properties of exotic states of matter and energy that are not accessible to Earth-based laboratories.<br/><br/>The LIGO Collaboration has built highly sensitive laser interferometric gravitational wave receivers in Hanford, WA and Livingston, LA that will measure to extra-galactic distances the minute oscillations of space-time caused by, for example, the merger of two neutron stars.  Data from these observatories will be streamed in real-time to supercomputing facilities across the U.S where thousands of computing nodes will integrate millions of unique physical models of black hole and neutron star systems, known as templates, with the data in real time.  Advanced signal processing techniques and software co-developed by the PI will infer the presence of a signal from any of the models within seconds of the signal arriving at Earth.  Requiring signals to be observed simultaneously in multiple geographically separated gravitational wave detectors will allow the position of the source to be localized as well as provide confidence that the signal is not of terrestrial origin.  The best-fit parameters and estimate of the event significance will be ingested into the gravitational-wave candidate event database where alerts to external partners will be issued as well as real-time correlation with external triggers such as gamma-ray bursts through the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network (GCN)."

This breakthrough marks the beginning of the era of GW astronomy. The planned research bridges the fields of general relativity and astrophysics, by studying the generation of gravitational waves, relativistic hydrodynamics, and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. A common thread uniting the different theoretical topics is the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic gravitation. This award provides major funding for research in general relativity at UIUC and a significant component of the total support in theoretical astrophysics to that institution.  An appreciable portion of the funding is devoted to the education, training and support of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. These students collaborate with the PI on the majority of research topics funded by the project. The grant supports the activities of the PI's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) team at UIUC in computational astrophysics and general relativity theory. The training that each of the PI's undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students receives in large-scale computations and scientific visualization, as well as in several different areas of theoretical physics and astrophysics, prepares them to pursue professional careers in a broad range of scientific and technical fields. The computer algorithms and numerical codes that are developed are useful to other groups working in computational physics and astrophysics. Through the research and outreach activities of the PI and his group, the grant helps promote the use of computers and visualization tools at all levels of education, as well as the public awareness of some the latest and most exciting developments in gravitation physics and astrophysics.<br/><br/>Compact objects provide the principal forum of the studies, and the dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field is a major theme. Some of the topics for investigation include the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries (binary black holes, binary neutron stars and  binary black hole--neutron stars), the generation of gravitational waves from binaries and other promising astrophysical sources and the accompanying electromagnetic signals, gravitational collapse, the stability of rotating, relativistic stars and the evolution and final fate of unstable stars, gamma-ray burst sources, circumbinary disks around merging supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and quasars, and the profile and observable consequences of dark matter around supermassive black holes in galaxy cores, including the Milky Way. Most of these topics represent long-standing, fundamental problems in theoretical physics requiring large-scale computation for solution. Hence the approach involves to a significant degree large-scale computations on parallel machines, as well as analytical modeling. They comprise both initial value and evolution computations and treat vacuum spacetimes containing black holes as well as spacetimes containing realistic matter sources, magnetic fields and both electromagnetic and neutrino radiation (""multimessenger astronomy"").

A large component of the research is aimed at the numerical solution of Einstein's equations by supercomputer simulations.  The proposed research will have a broad impact on our understanding of fundamental physics. The first real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes are just beginning to occur with experiments like LIGO. To confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. Are the black holes that LIGO observes the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? The research will have an impact on astronomy.  Mergers of binary systems containing neutron stars may lead to the emission of electromagnetic and neutrino signals, as well as gravitational waves.  This opens the possibility of concurrently observing such events in multiple ways leading to greater understanding of such events.  The simulations will help determine the parameters of such binaries that lead to the strongest electromagnetic and neutrino signals, and the characteristics of these signals (timescale, strength, etc.) that may be important in developing optimal search strategies for detecting these signals. The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques to be developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand. Relativity and black holes continue to fascinate the public and allow science to be communicated broadly. Movies of simulations produced by the investigators will continue to provide public outreach.<br/><br/>To solve Einstein's equations, the investigators will use a computational technique, pseudospectral collocation, that delivers high accuracy with a much smaller computational cost than other techniques.  One focus is to track the coalescence and merger of binary black hole systems and to calculate the gravitational waveform emitted by such processes.  A second focus of the research is to study the coalescence and merger of binary systems containing a neutron star and a black hole, or two neutron stars. The investigators will include ever more realistic descriptions of the microphysics in the simulations, such as the equation of state of nuclear matter, neutrino effects, and magnetic fields. The investigators will also develop a new code for computational astrophysics that is designed to take advantage of upcoming exascale machines in a way that current codes cannot.  This new code will be based on discontinuous Galerkin methods and task-based parallelism. It will provide transformative capabilities not only for numerical relativity, but for many problems in computational astrophysics."

The objectives delineated above align perfectly with the Principal Investigator Yunes' long-term goals, who has years of experience building up to this objective. The impact of gravitational waves signaling a systematic departure from Einstein's predictions is clearly breathtaking. But the lack of a departure from Einstein's theory would also constitute a huge step for Science, proving for once and for all that Einstein's theory is also valid in the most extreme gravitational scenarios. <br/><br/>Gravitational wave astrophysics is entering a new era of discovery and exploration, with first detections expected within the next few years with Advanced LIGO, the ground-based interferometer in the United States. One of the key missions of LIGO is to test Einstein's theory of General Relativity where it has never been tested before: where the gravitational force is enormous relative to Earth's or the Sun's pull. Such a task is achievable because gravitational waves encode information about this force when black holes and neutron stars collide in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. The main objective of this award is to fund a scientific workshop that will bring together experts in gravitational wave theory and data analysis, together with experts in modified gravity theories, to discuss how the discovery of gravitational waves can be leveraged to learn more about Einstein's theory.

A revolutionary prediction of Einstein's gravitational theory is that accelerated bodies produce gravitational waves, analogous to the way electric charges produce electromagnetic waves. At present, gravitational waves have only been detected indirectly by the way they deplete energy from two co-orbiting pulsars. A Laser Interferometric Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO) has been constructed that is expected to open up a new form of astronomy by direct detection of these waves.

In particular, we plan to address several key physics issues such as: (i) How important is neutron star spin in the evolution of neutron star binaries? (ii) How can we best join a very long post-Newtonian in-spiral waveform and a numerically obtained waveform from a compact object binary?

For the so-called `Advanced'  versions of these detectors, anticipated event rates from  mergers are ~102/yr.  Naturally, one will want to glean as  much astronomical information as possible from these  detections:  one will want to determine the angular position  and distance to the binary, whether the bodies are neutron  stars or black holes, the masses of the two bodies,  et cetera.  Prof. Cutler will initiate a program of research  to determine how accurately LIGO/VIRGO can measure these  quantities.  In extracting this information from the  gravitational wave signal, there are two kinds of errors:  measurement errors due to detector noise, and theoretical  errors due to limitations on the ability of relativists to  accurately calculate the inspiral waveform for a given set  of binary parameters.  Cutler is investigating both kinds of  error, using a mixture of Monte Carlo and analytic  techniques.  The analysis is made difficult by the fact that  much of the interesting information is encoded in small,  post-Newtonian pieces of the waveform.    There are three principal motivations for the above  research.  First, it provides guidance to experimentalists  as to which elements of the detector design are most crucial  for doing astronomy.  Second, it provides theorists a guide  to the level of accuracy they must `shoot for' in solving  the two-body problem.  Third, the results allow one to judge  the feasibility of potential astronomical applications of  binary coalescences, such as using them as standard candles  to determine the Hubble constant."

The proposed research will build upon the BayesWave algorithm that was developed under two predecessor awards. BayesWave separates gravitational wave burst signals from the pops and crackles of the instrument noise. The BayesWave analysis helped confirm the first detection of gravitational waves, and results from the analysis can be found in the first figure of the discovery paper. The LIGO project presents young researchers and students with a wonderful opportunity to participate in the birth of a new observation science that is poised to make discoveries that will revolutionize astronomy and deliver unique insights into some of the Universe's most exotic phenomena.

The group plans to produce new web-based educational resources that illustrate the signal processing techniques used in their research by applying them to related problems in auditory signal analysis.<br/><br/>The supported work will improve and extend the BayesWave algorithm in several ways, including the development of targeted searches for specific signals, providing new functionality in the extraction of physical information about the signal that can aid in the identification of the source, and developing a low-latency capability. The new directed searches will target the post-merger signals from neutron star binaries, burst-trains from high eccentricity systems, and the late inspiral, merger and ringdown of high mass black hole binaries. The physically parameterized models used in these targeted analyses will allow us to produce estimates for quantities such as the masses, spins, and radii of the compact objects. For signals from unknown sources it is important to thoroughly characterize the signal to make connection with possible astrophysical models for the source. To this end, the group will develop new tools to extract information about the time-frequency development of the signal, and related measures such as rise and decay times. A low-latency version of the algorithm will provide a new frontline search capability that will compliment, and give redundancy to, the existing burst search pipelines."

Gravitational waves allow us to study some of the Universe's most extreme systems, such as the mergers of two black holes or neutron stars, which would otherwise remain hidden from us. In its first two observing runs, the Advanced LIGO detector network discovered gravitational waves from 10 binary black hole mergers and one binary neutron star merger. In future runs, the rate of detections will accelerate, with binaries being found every few days. These unique observations will enable us to answer long-standing questions in astrophysics like: What are masses of black holes? How are binaries of black holes and neutron stars made? How do massive stars explode and leave black hole or neutron star remains? Does the population of black holes change as the Universe evolves? What role do neutron star mergers play in forging heavy elements like gold? To answer these questions requires reliable and efficient techniques to analyse the rapidly growing collection of gravitational-wave data. The research supported by this grant supports the development of cutting edge statistical techniques to extract the information encoded in gravitational-wave data, and use this the unravel the central mysteries of black hole and neutron star binaries.<br/><br/>Specifically, two main research objectives are targeted: (i) Inferring the physical parameters of merging binaries from gravitational-wave signals more efficiently (through improvements to sampling algorithms and through automation) and more accurately (accounting for realistic, non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise, and accounting for missing physics, such as eccentricity, in our current gravitational-wave models); (ii) Performing population inferences from the ensemble of the detections, using parametric and non-parametric models to reconstruct distributions of merging binaries (in terms of masses, spins and redshifts), and comparing results to astrophysical models to constrain the currently uncertain physics of binary evolution (such as common-envelope efficiency and supernova kicks). The inference tools developed will be made publicly available to enable the rapid advancement of gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of frequent detections. Furthermore, the latest results of gravitational-wave astronomy, and the excitement of multimessenger astronomy, will be communicated to diverse audiences through a range of outreach activities ranging from planetarium events to popular science writing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finally, they will develop a new version of BOB with an evolving background spacetime in order to ensure accuracy at earlier times, and thereby create a model with comparable accuracy to NR, but entirely independent from NR. They will apply this model to conduct a detailed comparison with existing NR-calibrated models, in order to better establish systematic uncertainties. This work will ensure that future gravitational-wave observations are only limited by the sensitivity of the instrument, and not by the presence of modeling error. In addition, this proposal will help facilitate a program of outreach that will reach schools and venues for the general public throughout the state of West Virginia, by developing new demonstrations and presentations and training students within the WV SPOT program and the WVU Astronomy Club to present them, and also by bringing a major outreach event, an updated version of the Celebrating Einstein performances previously hosted at WVU, to multiple venues, and to numerous audiences including entire classes of students from schools throughout the state.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the onset of advanced gravitational wave detectors, only recently have astronomers begun to place direct constraints on these processes. Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), which are detected at cosmological distances, also offer a unique and independent window into the dynamic and colorful lives of compact object mergers. A research group at Northwestern University, under the direction of the principal investigator (PI), will capitalize on complementary streams of data from gravitational wave observatories, ground-based telescopes and space-based gamma-ray and X-ray missions to: (i) develop informed follow-up strategies for electromagnetic (EM) observations following gravitational wave events, (ii) confront theoretical models of heavy element production in mergers with optical and near-infrared observations, (iii) place constraints on the fraction of mergers that produce SGRBs with radio through X-ray observations, and (iv) decipher the histories of the pre-merger binary systems with a complete census of their host galaxies.  To make this research publicly accessible in a novel way, the PI will partner with Evanston (Illinois) Township High School (ETHS) which has an on-campus planetarium. The PI will use the planetarium as a venue for engaging students with research material and exposing students to Astronomy researchers from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The research group will utilize the inferred properties of previous SGRBs to build light curve prediction tools that will optimize an observatory's chance of an EM counterpart detection following a gravitational wave event. These adaptable tools will serve as an important community resource, not only for determining current observing strategies but also for planning future EM surveys. The research group will also place direct, observational constraints on the role of mergers in populating the Universe with heavy elements, by determining independently-measured ejecta masses and event rates.  The researchers will build a complete census of SGRB host galaxies and the spatial offsets of bursts from the galaxy centers.  From these observations, the researchers will determine the distributions of merger kick velocities and delay times. These distributions are vital inputs for binary evolution models, yet they are highly uncertain. The project is well-designed to exploit both methods of merger discovery: gravitational wave emission from Advanced LIGO/Virgo and gamma-ray burst detection from space-based missions.  For all objectives in this proposal, the research group will make crucial connections between the local population of compact object mergers discovered by Advanced LIGO/Virgo and their cosmological analogues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modeling and understanding of gravitational-wave sources is becoming extremely important as scientists are utilizing data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory to detect black holes and other exotic astrophysical objects (such as ""neutron stars"").  On one level, astronomers require large computers to develop programs that can help us understand the large amounts of data from gravitational-wave detectors, and pick out the real, astronomical sources from a wide variety of noise sources.  But in addition, as detections of gravitational-wave sources occur more frequently, astronomers need to understand what those detections can tell us about the population of exotic objects throughout the universe.  For instance, given the detections of gravitational-wave sources already, researchers ask how many black holes there might be, in our galaxy, and in other galaxies, and how massive are they?  Also, researchers ask: how do those black holes form, and how do systems of pairs of black holes form?  These are important questions in understanding objects at the extreme of the known laws of physics, and to answer these questions, astronomers need to understand not only the lives of individual stars and the formation of black holes and neutron stars, but they need to simulate populations of millions of stars, and the wide variety of events and processes that can affect the development of those stars.  For that work, astrophysicists require large collections of very efficient computers, such as the computer cluster that will be purchased with these funds, to run massive simulations that help us explore these questions.  In addition to the pure research that will be done with this cluster, the PI's group is also well known for generating award-winning visualizations of their simulations, which will be used at a variety of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and public-outreach events.  The entire team also has extensive experience in attracting a diverse group of researchers to STEM research and fields; this cluster will help that group to train a new generation of diverse researchers in data-science methods and scientific computing, contributing to the technical workforce of the nation.<br/> <br/>  This grant will allow the acquisition of a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster that will enable research in the emerging area of gravitational physics. The cluster will be essential to the development and optimization of codes needed for both gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis as part of the Laser-Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration, and GW source modeling for the physical interpretation of the detections. The equipment consists of a large computer cluster (56 nodes) with InfiniBand networking and 70 TB of usable storage.  This cluster will incorporate three innovative Graphics-Programming-Unit nodes (using GPUs appropriate for scientific computing) which will be used as accelerators for special-purpose massively parallel computations.  The cluster will be housed at a top-of-the-line HPC data center on the Northwestern University campus and will be operated and managed by an experienced team of HPC professionals led by one of the co-PIs.  In more detail, the cluster will be used for GW research focused on binaries with two compact objects (neutron stars and/or black holes) in interdisciplinary collaborations between GW data analysts (members of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration), astrophysicists, and computer scientists. The goals are to optimize data searches for GW signals (through effective detector characterization), to extract as promptly as possible and accurately the physical properties of the signal sources (through continuous improvements of our parameter-estimation algorithms), and to advance the astrophysical interpretation of the discoveries so we can better understand the sources' origin and constrain theoretical models using our GW observations (through the development of state-of-the-art formation models in different environments and comparing predictions to data). The team is led by PI Kalogera and co-PI Rasio, who are well recognized for their significant impact in these research areas and for their innovative development of new computational tools for GW data analysis and astrophysical modeling of GW sources."

Scientists can now very directly explore nature under extreme conditions such as those that occur with merging black holes or neutron stars. Cosmologists intend to use gravitational waves to probe deep into the earliest moments of the big bang. Rather than monitoring changes to the lengths of the 4km-long arms of the LIGO detectors, cosmologists are seeking the imprint of gravitational waves on polarization patterns in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) -- light that, for the most part, last interacted with matter when the universe was just a few hundred thousand years old. If the simplest and most empirically successful scenario for the generation of density perturbations in the early universe is correct, the resulting signal should be observable. Such a detection would open up a new, and more direct, window on this ultra-early epoch as well as our first experimental probe of quantum-mechanical aspects of the gravitational field and allow us to test theories of the origin of spatial structure (density inhomogeneities) in our universe. To achieve the sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves (PGWs), being targeted by experiments in the planning stages now (such as the ?Stage IV? experiment), requires the development of new statistical tools -- in particular for the quantification of uncertainties in the removal of contaminants to the signal of interest. This project will directly address these statistical challenges by focusing on the two main obstacles for the detection of primordial gravitational waves in the CMB: contamination from gravitational lensing and millimeter wavelength radiation from the interstellar medium in our own galaxy. The statistical methodology resulting from the proposed work will not only enable some very exciting science, but also inform a broad range of statistical problems associated with large spatial datasets. <br/><br/>This project directly addresses the two main statistical challenges associated with the detection of primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background (CMB): contamination from gravitational lensing and the emission of millimeter wavelength radiation from the interstellar medium in our own galaxy. The first part of the project is the development of a full-scale Bayesian solution to the delensing problem using a new re-parameterization technique derived from a dynamical systems characterization of delensing and an artificial decoherence technique specifically designed to overcome the slow mixing of Gibbs samplers associated with CMB delensing. This custom re-parameterization, using the physics of how lensing aliases E-modes and B-modes in the CMB polarization, can exhibit properties of both a sufficient parametrization for the E-mode and an ancillary parameterization for the polarization B-mode. This is crucial for fast mixing of the main Gibbs chain and for high acceptance rates of Hamiltonian Markov chains for Bayesian delensing. The second main part of the project directly addresses the challenges associated with foreground contaminants: in particular the quantification of uncertainty that propagates through the observations to the estimated B-mode fluctuations from primordial gravitational waves. The project will focus on developing new random field models of the non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity aimed at quantifying uncertainty rather than the estimation, and subsequent removal, of foreground emission. The resulting models and techniques will also inform general statistical applications associated with non-stationary random field models and the hierarchical modeling of non-Gaussian spatial random fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Only a few years ago,  the  Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) began a revolution in our understanding of the universe, with the first gravitational wave (GW) observations of coalescing black holes and neutron stars.  These ripples in spacetime carry information otherwise hidden from view, enabling unique insight into the most energetic transient phenomena in our universe.  Due to  ongoing NSF support,   gravitational wave observations   now accumulate at an ever-increasing pace.  Previously unidentified sources are and will be uncovered.  Some, like merging neutron stars, can produce associated and distinctive electromagnetic emission.  These new sources and populations may push the frontiers of what we predict can happen, or challenge our capability to interpret what did happen.   The physical parameters of individual sources can be estimated from observed signals based on approximate predictions of their gravitational wave and/or electromagnetic emission.  Likewise, the physics responsible for an individual source or collection of sources can be deduced from their distinctive or well-measured collective properties, based on models for how they form.   The goal of this project is to help produce and interpret this new cosmic census, rapidly and reliably identifying new events and populations to inform follow-up observations and modeling.<br/><br/>This project has two major activities designed to enable multimessenger observations of GW sources to achieve their immense potential.  First, the group will construct and operate high-cadence, low-latency parameter and population inference codes for gravitational wave sources.  Principally created for interpreting LIGO's concrete observations, the group will also use these codes to assess and mitigate how much astrophysical conclusions depend on key uncertainties: the presence of matter (versus vacuum); the accuracy of our approximations to general relativity; and the significance of each source, given data quality.  Second, the team will develop and employ new phenomenological methods with which to interpret the cosmic multimessenger census, emphasizing  physically-parameterized and generative approaches based on detailed physical models. One long-term goal of this project is to help assemble the necessary framework  for the  discovery and interpretation of new high-impact populations, including high-mass and high-mass-ratio binaries; binary neutron stars; neutron star/black hole binaries; and  more exotic populations with distinctive observable signatures in their physical parameters.

The process of parameter estimation requires that the observed wave be compared to many millions of gravitational waves generated by theoretical models.

Key follow-up observations of fast-fading or fast-moving events must occur at night promptly after discovery but before the sun rises. A relay of telescopes spanning multiple longitudes on earth will pass the baton amongst each other to effectively extend the night-time darkness.

The torrent of data thus generated shall be used to improve both astronomical observing techniques and big data management and analysis (such as machine learning algorithms, database design and statistics). In addition, the intrinsically international context of the GROWTH program shall foster the development of relationships and social capital required to navigate effectively among diverse science cultures from around the world. Therefore, participating students will have the quantitative, computational and interpersonal skills to assume leadership roles in the knowledge economy. <br/><br/>GROWTH will address several frontier questions in time domain astronomy systematically. GROWTH aims to characterize the electromagnetic emission from binary neutron star mergers, thereby localizing the prime source of gravitational waves expected to be detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO). Timely spectroscopy may identify the long sought cosmic location of heavy element production. GROWTH would track small near-earth asteroids of the type that may pose hazards, to characterize their orbit, size, type and rotation properties. GROWTH shall have a front-row seat to observe the end points of stellar evolution by routinely obtaining data in the first 24 hours of a new-born supernova and directly probing the chemistry and history of the progenitor star. The GROWTH education program will train students and postdocs and encompass undergraduate course development, international internships, annual workshops and a research conference.

Included among these are compact binary objects, composed of black holes and neutron stars, as well as gamma ray bursts and related phenomena. Such objects are powerful engines for the production of gravitational, electromagnetic and neutrino radiation. Many research groups as well as observatories and experiments (both planned and already in operation), are engaged in attempting to observe, interpret and understand these emissions. Their overall understanding will be enhanced and furthered as theoretical insight and predictions are used to aid in their detection and in testing fundamental theories and phenomena. Our purpose here is to systematically consider non-vacuum compact binary systems and to do so with sufficient fidelity to obtain their emissions in gravitational and electromagnetic waves. We will do so by incorporating realistic equations of state, electromagnetic interactions and cooling effects. In particular, our approach is to tie ever more tightly together our theoretical understanding of the possible components and sources of multi-messenger astrophysics. We will build our efforts on a strong computational foundation, namely a robust implementation of the equations of general relativistic, resistive magnetohydrodynamics with adaptive mesh refinement. <br/><br/>This research is of broad interest and naturally combines expertise and know-how that reaches beyond physicists to astrophysicists and mathematicians. It will advance our understanding of some of the most intriguing processes in the universe, and will provide valuable candidate waveforms for gravitational wave observatories (e.g. LIGO). Our participation in multinational efforts to compare waveforms and approaches will be especially valuable to the gravitational wave and astrophysical communities. The activities described here will help further undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral research and training, including a number of underrepresented individuals.

Gravitational waves carry important information about their origin that can extracted through careful comparisons to theoretical calculations, such as full-scale computer simulations of binary mergers. This project will study mergers of binary neutron stars and black holes using computer simulations created by Dendro-GR, a new computer code that runs very efficiently on the largest supercomputers.

These efforts will aid in expanding the use of gravitational wave detections from confirming general relativity to providing additional, even more stringent tests of both the theory and other possible competing theories.  Combining data from computer simulations with both gravitational and electromagnetic observations will allow us to probe, in a manner heretofore impossible, the physics of black holes and neutron stars, of gamma-ray bursts, of kilonovae and supernovae, and of even the formation of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.

The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) will mosaic six High Definition format InGaAs detectors to produce the world's widest-area IR camera and conduct a deep robotic survey of the dynamic infrared sky. In addition to its primary science mission, studying how the heaviest elements of the periodic table are synthesized in colliding neutron stars identified via gravitational waves, WINTER will devote observing time to support undergraduate research and laboratory education at the intersection of Big Data and the physical sciences.<br/><br/>WINTER is an infrared camera with a 1.2 x 1.0 degree field of view that will be installed on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. A simple prototype shows that thermo-electrically cooled InGaAs behind an ambient temperature optical train yields broadband images (at 0.9-1.7 microns) limited by shot noise from the sky, rather than sensor noise. This removes the requirement for cryogenic optics and vacuum cryostats, greatly reducing system cost and complexity relative to traditional IR imagers with HgCdTe sensors. During each year of a 5-year baseline survey, WINTER will monitor the entire Northern sky to a depth of J=19.2 (single visit), or J=20 (combined), and release calibrated images and transient alerts to the public. WINTER is sensitive to emission from the r-process enhanced ejecta of kilonovae over the full horizon of Advanced LIGO, and will autonomously interrupt its sky survey to search for the isotropic infrared counterparts of gravitational-wave events.  WINTER's IR capability is uniquely sensitive to emission from both binary neutron star mergers and neutron star-black hole mergers independent of viewing angle, opacity, mass ratio and remnant lifetime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports an integrated research program to investigate the confluence of three spectacular predictions of Einstein?s theory of general relativity: gravitational lensing, black holes (BHs), and gravitational waves (GWs).  Gravitational lensing occurs when the gravitational field of a foreground object like a galaxy or galaxy cluster bends the path of radiation emitted by a background source as it travels towards the observer.  BHs are massive objects so compact that they possess an event horizon from within which even light cannot escape.  GWs are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that exert time-varying tidal forces on objects as they pass through them.  This research program will investigate how gravitational lensing affects the GWs and electromagnetic (EM) radiation emitted by distant binary BHs and their surrounding gas.  It has three main goals: (1) to determine the probability that GW sources are lensed and the strength of lensing magnification and distortion, (2) to assess whether lensing can be observationally distinguished from intrinsic changes to the properties of the background sources, and (3) to identify how joint (multi-messenger) GW and EM observations of gravitational lensing can reveal properties of the foreground lenses, background sources, and the lensing phenomenon itself that would be inaccessible to GW or EM observations individually.  This research will promote the progress of science by significantly advancing the understanding of gravitational lensing as a multi-messenger phenomenon. This research program will also benefit society by supporting education and public outreach.  It will fund research assistantships for two graduate students in the physics PhD program at the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) and also provide opportunities for undergraduate research.  Einstein?s legacy (especially the research topics in this proposal) has always fascinated the public and thus serves as a valuable tool for outreach to underrepresented groups.  The team will present this research to diverse audiences including the TAG Magnet School in Dallas ISD, the UTD Women in Physics summer camp, the Texas Astronomical Society of amateur astronomers, and the Frontiers of Flight and Perot museums in Dallas.<br/><br/>Current and future GW detectors will observe three classes of sources: (1) stellar-mass binary BH mergers like those seen by LIGO/Virgo, (2) supermassive black-hole (SMBH) mergers that are the primary target of LISA, and (3) extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) of compact objects into SMBHs.  The proposed research will investigate strong gravitational lensing of these sources in three interrelated projects. (1) the PI's group will calculate the distribution of lensing amplification factors for sources at cosmological redshift, using wave or geometric optics as appropriate.  They will then use this distribution to determine how strong lensing affects the three GW sources including the changes to the signal-to-noise ratio and the mismatch with the unlensed GW templates used for searches.  (2) The team will explore the degeneracies between gravitational lensing and changes to the source parameters that define unlensed waveforms.  In particular, they will determine the extent to which GW amplitude modulation due to misaligned spins can mimic the interference between multiple images, and whether changes to the waveform inclination and polarization angle can be distinguished from the coherent sum of lensed images with different polarization angles and parities.  (3) The group will investigate the synergy between GW and EM observations of strongly lensed systems.  This study will address whether upcoming EM surveys like LSST can provide catalogs to help identify the host galaxy of lensed GW events, if lensing reconstruction from EM observations can help identify time-delayed ?images? in GW data, and whether combined EM and GW observations can improve the constraints on lens and source models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, with the arrival of the second-generation gravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, first detections of gravitational waves produced in astrophysical and cosmological processes are expected to be made over the next decade. This project focuses on gravitational waves emitted on long time scales, such as the stationary stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) generated by an incoherent superposition of signals from many independent sources. The project also targets transient gravitational-wave signals on the time-scales of minutes, hours or longer, generated by a variety of astrophysical processes such as dynamically formed black-hole binaries or fragmentation in accretion disks around black holes. Cross-correlation techniques will be applied to the first data to be acquired by the second-generation detectors in search for these long-lasting signals. With over 1000 times better sensitivity than the latest published results, these searches will probe and constrain a number of proposed SGWB models. Furthermore, the SGWB models will be systematically studied to precisely identify the open science questions within these models that could be pursued by the second-generation detectors. Examples of such open questions include: What is the equation of state in neutron stars? What is the coalescence rate of binary neutron stars? Which cosmological models of SGWB are accessible to the second-generation detectors?<br/><br/>This project is expected to have a strong impact on cosmology and astrophysics. For example, the SGWB is expected to be generated just moments after the Big Bang, and hence may contain unique information about the first moments in the evolution of the universe and about the physics of highest energy scales, which is otherwise not accessible in laboratories. Similarly, the SGWB could be of astrophysical origin: for example, summing up contributions from all binary neutron stars, binary black holes, magnetars, or Supernovae in the universe leads to a stochastic gravitational-wave ""foreground"" that contains information about these most violent objects and events in the universe. The long-lasting transient gravitational-wave signals will also provide information about the astrophysical objects and processes that generated them. For example, direct detection of gravitational-wave signals produced by dynamically formed black hole binaries would shed light on the population of black holes that lurk in the inner regions of nearby galaxies, revealing their density and velocity distribution."

Seismometer arrays are commonly used in geophysics, seismology, and engineering to study the propagation of seismic waves, detect and study their sources, and assess properties of the Earth's interior at various depths. The vast majority of seismometer arrays to date have been surface-based due to the ease of installation. This project will build and operate a dense, underground, three-dimensional array of 13 high-sensitivity broadband seismometers. The array will be located at the Homestake mine, SD, whose accessible depth of 4850 feet and vast horizontal span allow probing a 1-mile underground cube. Bringing together the existing techniques in gravitational physics and geophysics for analysis of transient and stochastic wave signals, this project is expected to give rise to qualitatively new seismic data analysis techniques. Importantly, results of these studies will also have a profound impact on the design of future underground experiments in gravitational physics, such as probes of the Equivalence Principle of Einstein's theory of relativity. Future underground gravitational-wave detectors that will observe otherwise inaccessible signatures of various astrophysical phenomena and of the Big Bang will also be designed based on the seismic noise studies conducted within this project.<br/><br/>This project will enable interactions between the geophysics and gravitational physics communities that would be of substantial mutual benefit. Since the future of gravity experiments is arguably underground, it is critical for the gravitational physics community to draw from the large body of knowledge in geophysics on seismic noise and seismic wave propagation. By allowing a team of physicists and geophysicists to work together on the analysis of this unique high-quality data in a mutually interesting environment, this project will lead to breakthroughs in seismic noise tomography. Such breakthroughs will have a broad range of applications and societal implications, ranging from nondestructive material testing to medical diagnosis, geophysical prospecting (detecting mineral deposits and oil), and homeland security (detecting underground cavities). The project will also educate several graduate and undergraduate students, exposing them to the frontiers of research at the intersection of the fields of geophysics and gravitational physics."

Like a bell sounding its last notes, these problems all share a common feature: they exhibit oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitudes around an equilibrium state. A famous theoretical example concerns gravitational waves, recently detected by the LIGO detector. In technological settings, the ratio between the oscillation and decay rates to equilibrium is called the quality factor. Minimizing this ratio improves the stability and rigidity properties of the materials involved. Such technological applications include engineering graphene-like insulators; conception of waveguides and optic fibers; and design of high-quality microelectrical systems. <br/><br/>The mathematical study of such phenomena relies on a unified framework called resonance theory. It investigates natural  generalizations of time-harmonic states in situations where the energy may escape or decay. Generalized energies of such states form a discrete set of complex numbers called quantum resonances (in quantum scattering), quasinormal modes (in general relativity) or Pollicott--Ruelle resonances (in dynamical systems). Their imaginary parts describe the typical frequency of the associated resonant states while the real parts describe their decay or growth outside bounded regions. Mathematically, they are the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the Hamiltonian resolvent. Much of the theoretical work consists in studying their stability and asymptotic distributions; and how they affect time evolution. This project specifically deals with the emergence of resonances under symmetry-breaking perturbations in periodic structures; the exponential convergence of Hawking radiation in black-hole spacetimes; and the relation between topology and Pollicott--Ruelle resonances in dynamical systems. Natural tools include complex analysis and Fredholm operator theory; the classical-to-quantum correspondence principle within the microlocal framework; and partial differential equations techniques such as multiscale analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A well-motivated candidate for Dark Matter is a light axion. Axions have been introduced to explain the smallness of the violation of the Charge-Parity (CP) symmetry in Quantum ChromoDynamics, the theory describing the action of the strong force. Dark matter axions may be detected through their conversion into a narrow Radio Frequency (RF) signal in a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. This Yale-Berkeley-Colorado collaboration came together to design, build and operate an advanced technology experiment, HAYSTAC, to serve both as an innovation test-bed to develop new cavity designs and quantum-limited photon detection schemes, and as a pathfinder to take first data in the 10 - 50 micro-eV mass range, well above all previous such searches for axions. <br/><br/>R&D on superconducting thin-films, and sub-quantum-limited photon detection will certainly produce unanticipated spin-offs, just as the NSF-supported development of the Microstrip SQUID Amplifier for axions did in the quantum information world.

In addition, it is planned to establish a rotating exhibit on dark-sector science at the San Francisco Exploratorium utilizing prototypes and artifacts from many of the historic dark sector and cosmic microwave background experiments.<br/><br/>Short of finding the axion, HAYSTAC has been extraordinarily successful. During the past three-year period, the experiment has achieved essentially quantum-limited operation (no other experiment has come within an order of magnitude). In preparation for Phase II, Berkeley has designed and built a microwave cavity with a high figure of merit for the 6 - 12 GHz range (~ 25 - 50 micro-eV). Colorado has designed, built and characterized a squeezed-vacuum state receiver, now being commissioned in HAYSTAC - it will be the first-ever sub-quantum receiver for a dark-matter experiment, and with LIGO the first squeezed-state receivers for data production in the world of fundamental physics. Furthermore, the group will produce a first cavity prototype incorporating planar thin-films of NbTiN, a Type-II superconductor, to achieve a boost in quality factor Q by an order of magnitude, a gain that would map directly into mass scan rate. Each of these innovations dramatically enhances the discovery potential of HAYSTAC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such an integrated program is extremely timely, as gravitational waves were detected directly for the first time in September 2015 using LIGO, which has long been funded by NSF, and the era of gravitational wave and multimessenger astronomy has begun. The project addresses fundamental questions in gravitational and nuclear physics: (I) Is General Relativity correct in the strong and dynamical field regime of gravity? (II) What is the nature of supranuclear matter? The proposed research establishes a new framework for probing the extreme nature of gravity and dense matter physics with gravitational wave observations. Such a research program will significantly enhance the ability of extracting the scientific return from current and future observations. Understanding the extreme nature of gravity and dense matter may bring implications also to other fields, including particle and high energy physics and cosmology. The outreach part of the project tries to develop public's interests, curiosity and enthusiasms in science by connecting them to the frontier scientific research on gravitational waves through multiple outreach events. Such activities allow the PI and collaborators to directly reach, inspire and excite, in particular, the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>The research objectives are (i) to maximize the ability of extracting gravitational physics information from the currently-available gravitational wave data, (ii) to consider new sources of gravitational waves as probes of strong and dynamical field gravity and (iii) to reveal how accurately one can determine the equation of state for supranuclear matter with current and future gravitational wave observations. PI Yagi will take the following methodology to achieve the above research goals. On the gravitational physics front, the PI's team will focus on studying corrections away from General Relativity entering in the amplitude of gravitational waveforms that have mostly been neglected. The team will also consider astrophysical stochastic backgrounds as new sources of gravitational waves to probe strong and dynamical field gravity. On the nuclear physics front, PI Yagi and collaborators will carry out a detailed Bayesian parameter estimation study by including spin precession and adopting universal relations for neutron stars that do not depend strongly on the unknown equation of state. They will also study universal relations among tidal parameters and nuclear physics parameters so that one can directly probe the latter with gravitational wave observations. The educational part of the proposal aims at conveying the historical discovery of gravitational waves and the beauty of General Relativity to the public. PI Yagi and collaborators will achieve this goal by displaying a planetarium show created by collaborator Yunes at Montana State University at several different planetarium domes in Virginia, including those at James Madison University and Radford University.

With this award, Berkeley and Colorado plan two lines of R&D: (i) Berkeley will pursue boosting the cavity Q by incorporating multilayer structures of thin-film superconductors into the cavity design, as well as exploring Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structures as practical resonators for higher frequency operation; and (ii) Colorado/JILA will focus on reducing amplifier noise below the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), initially by incorporating a JPA-based squeezed-vacuum state receiver. This would be only the second application of a squeezed-state receiver, beside the GEO/LIGO gravity wave interferometers. Later, photon detector systems based on superconducting qubits inside of a cavity will be developed and deployed. Technical deliverables anticipated are to (a) extend the mass range of the search to 12 GHz (~50 micro-eV), and (b) deliver an improvement in power sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and thus approach sensitivity to Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axions.

In domains as crucial to our society as climate modeling, oceanography, particle physics, seismology, or computational biology (and in fact in most fields of physics, chemistry, and biology today), scientists nowadays routinely define ""scientific workflows"". These workflows are complex descriptions of scientific processes as data and inter-dependent computations on these data. When executed, typically with great expenses of computing, storage, and networking hardware, these workflows can produce groundbreaking results. A famous and recent example is the workflow that was used as part of the LIGO project to confirm the first detection of gravitational waves from colliding black holes. Scientific workflows are mainstays in today's science. Their efficient  execution (in terms of speed, reliability, and cost) is thus crucial. This project seeks to provide a software framework, called WRENCH (Workflow Simulation Workbench), that will make it possible to simulate large-scale hypothetical scenarios quickly and accurately on a single computer, obviating the need for expensive and time-consuming trial and error experiments. WRENCH potentially enables scientists to make quick and informed choices when executing their workflows, software developers to implement more efficient software infrastructures to support workflows, and researchers to develop novel efficient algorithms to be embedded within these software infrastructures.  In addition, WRENCH makes it possible to bring scientific workflow content into undergraduate and graduate computer science curricula. This is because meaningful knowledge can be gained by students using a single computer and the WRENCH software stack, making such learning possible even at institutions without access to high-end computing infrastructures, such as many non-Ph.D.-granting and minority-serving institutions. As a result, this work will contribute to producing computer science graduates better equipped to take an active role in the advancing of science.  Due to its potentially transformative impact on scientific workflow usage, development, research, and education, this project promises to promote the progress of science across virtually all its fields, ultimately resulting in broad and numerous benefits to our society.<br/><br/>Scientific workflows have become mainstream for conducting large-scale scientific research.  As a result, many workflow applications and Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) have been developed as part of the cyberinfrastructure to allow scientists to execute their applications seamlessly on a range of distributed platforms.  In spite of many success stories, building large-scale workflows and orchestrating their executions efficiently (in terms of performance, reliability, and cost) remains a challenge given the complexity of the workflows themselves and the complexity of the underlying execution platforms.  A fundamental necessary next step is the establishment of a solid ""experimental science"" approach for future workflow technology development. Such an approach is useful for scientists who need to design workflows and pick execution platforms, for WMS developers who need to compare alternate design and implementation options, and for researchers who need to develop novel decision-making algorithms to be implemented as part of WMSs.  The broad objective of this work is to provide foundational software, the Workflow Simulation Workbench (WRENCH), upon which to develop the above experimental science approach.  Capitalizing on recent advances in distributed application and platform simulation technology, WRENCH makes it possible to (i) quickly prototype workflow, WMS implementations, and decision-making algorithms; and (ii) evaluate/compare alternative options scalably and accurately for arbitrary, and often hypothetical, experimental scenarios.  This project will define a generic and foundational software architecture, that is informed by current state-of-the-art WMS designs and planned future designs.  The implementation of the components in this architecture when taken together form a generic ""scientific instrument"" that can be used by workflow users, developers, and researchers.  This scientific instrument will be instantiated for several real-world WMSs and used for a range of real-world workflow applications. In a particular case-study, it will be used with a popular WMS (Pegasus) to revisit published results and scheduling algorithms in the area of workflow planning optimizations. The objective is to demonstrate the benefit of using an experimental science approach for WMS research.  Another impact of this project is that it  makes it possible to include scientific workflow content pervasively in undergraduate and graduate computer science curricula, even for students without any access to computing infrastructure, by defining meaningful pedagogic activities that only require a computer and the WRENCH software stack. This educational impact will be demonstrated in the classroom in both undergraduate and graduate courses at our institutions."

Observational data of such systems comes from radio telescope detections of binaries with at least one pulsating neutron star, or pulsar, and from gravitational-wave observations of the final few seconds to minutes of the lives of the binary, when they inspiral and merge.  A research collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and Pennsylvania State University will use gravitational-wave observations to explore astrophysical models of compact binaries, using statistical inference and machine learning.  Among the specific scientific topics to be addressed are the details of how compact binaries form, the use of compact binary mergers to measure distances to sources far off in the universe, and understanding the state of matter in the dense cores of neutron stars.  The phenomenal discoveries by the gravitational-wave detectors have received a great deal of attention from the press and in social media. Black holes, neutron stars and gravitational waves are topics of great interest to the public, and have the potential to attract students in middle and high schools to STEM subjects who would have otherwise chosen other alternatives.  The researchers will use the current surge of interest in these areas to inform middle and high students of the excitement of research and discovery in the forefront of physics. <br/><br/>The proposed research will shed light on evolutionary models of compact binaries using a catalog of binary merger events observed by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. More specifically, the goal of the project is to discriminate between competing evolutionary models of compact binaries (dynamical interactions in clusters, evolution of isolated binaries, and primordial origin of binary black holes) from the measured distributions of masses, spins and other properties of compact object mergers. This study will help produce a map from the astrophysical models to the bulk properties of the systems measured from gravitational wave observations. Such maps, in combination with Bayesian inference and machine learning, will be used to gain a deeper understanding of the astrophysics of compact object binaries. The investigators will use compact binaries as accurate measures of distance to obtain peculiar velocities of galaxies and clusters, 3-d mapping of galaxies, and to characterize the gas, stellar and dark matter content of galaxies, comparing the results with other approaches. Gravitational wave observations are key to multi-messenger astronomy, which will help address the origin questions, such as how and when black holes formed and how they evolved, what constitutes the expansion history of the Universe, and what is the state of matter in dense cores of neutron stars. This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has opened up a new window in astronomy, enabling a deeper understanding of the physics of relativity through the study of merging BHs, the objects that bend space and time the most.  Since these interactions are so complicated, powerful computer simulations are needed to interpret the science.  A collaboration between research groups at the University of Mississippi and Pennsylvania State University will develop and run computer models to better understand the formation and development of compact binary star systems and to more effectively use the rich information from gravitational waves to probe these systems. A related effort is the development of methods to use GW in the future to study dark matter. The research team will also promote scientific literacy by providing astronomy lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities to school children and adult citizenry in economically disadvantaged communities in the state of Mississippi and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>The investigators will carry out two closely related projects to model the gravitational wave astrophysics of compact binary systems. The first project concerns the astrophysical information that can be extracted from the characteristic signature imposed on a gravitational wave signal due to the spin and the orbital precession of coalescing black hole binaries. The team will introduce spin dynamics into compact binary evolution models and track the evolution of BH binaries from formation through merger, including effects such as an initial supernova kick, mass transfer and spin-orbit coupling. An offshoot of this work is to investigate bounds on ultra-light bosonic dark matter though its possible GW signature. The second project will involve inferring compact binary population models from a catalog of gravitational wave observations. The team will put together a database of evolutionary models and work to distinguish between the predicted observables of the various models. Goals include understanding the distribution of BH masses, spins, and merger rates and the properties of the stochastic GW background. The principal investigators will mentor a graduate student and postdoctoral researcher and plan to organize two workshops on strong gravity and binary dynamics and to lecture at international graduate schools on work related to the proposal."

The intellectual scope of this research program spans several problems involving general relativity, the generation of gravitational radiation, relativistic hydrodynamics, and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. A common thread uniting the different theoretical topics is the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic gravitation. Compact objects provide the principal forum, and the dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field is a major theme. Some of the topics for investigation include the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries (binary black holes, binary neutron stars, binary black hole--neutron stars and binary white dwarf--neutron stars), the generation of gravitational waves from binaries and other promising astrophysical sources and the accompanying electromagnetic signals, gravitational collapse, the stability of rotating, relativistic stars and the evolution and final fate of unstable stars, gamma-ray burst sources, and circumbinary disks around merging supermassive black holes in the cores of galaxies and quasars. Most of these topics represent long-standing, fundamental problems in theoretical physics requiring large-scale computation for solution. Hence the approach involves to a significant degree large-scale computations on parallel machines, as well as analytical modeling. Many of the numerical calculations employ the state-of-the-art computational and visualization resources of the UIUC's National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). They comprise both initial value and evolution computations and treat vacuum spacetimes containing black holes as well as spacetimes containing realistic matter sources, magnetic fields and both electromagnetic and neutrino radiation.

It provides the main funding for research in general relativity at UIUC and a significant component of the total support in theoretical astrophysics to that institution. An appreciable portion of the funding is devoted to the education, training and support of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students. These students collaborate with the PI on the majority of research topics funded by the project. The grant supports the activities of the PI's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) team at UIUC in computational astrophysics and general relativity theory.

Observational data of such systems comes from radio telescope detections of binaries with at least one pulsating neutron star, or pulsar, and from gravitational-wave observations of the final few seconds to minutes of the lives of the binary, when they inspiral and merge.  A research collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and Pennsylvania State University will use gravitational-wave observations to explore astrophysical models of compact binaries, using statistical inference and machine learning.  Among the specific scientific topics to be addressed are the details of how compact binaries form, the use of compact binary mergers to measure distances to sources far off in the universe, and understanding the state of matter in the dense cores of neutron stars.  The phenomenal discoveries by the gravitational-wave detectors have received a great deal of attention from the press and in social media. Black holes, neutron stars and gravitational waves are topics of great interest to the public, and have the potential to attract students in middle and high schools to STEM subjects who would have otherwise chosen other alternatives.  The researchers will use the current surge of interest in these areas to inform middle and high students of the excitement of research and discovery in the forefront of physics. <br/><br/>The proposed research will shed light on evolutionary models of compact binaries using a catalog of binary merger events observed by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave detectors. More specifically, the goal of the project is to discriminate between competing evolutionary models of compact binaries (dynamical interactions in clusters, evolution of isolated binaries, and primordial origin of binary black holes) from the measured distributions of masses, spins and other properties of compact object mergers. This study will help produce a map from the astrophysical models to the bulk properties of the systems measured from gravitational wave observations. Such maps, in combination with Bayesian inference and machine learning, will be used to gain a deeper understanding of the astrophysics of compact object binaries. The investigators will use compact binaries as accurate measures of distance to obtain peculiar velocities of galaxies and clusters, 3-d mapping of galaxies, and to characterize the gas, stellar and dark matter content of galaxies, comparing the results with other approaches. Gravitational wave observations are key to multi-messenger astronomy, which will help address the origin questions, such as how and when black holes formed and how they evolved, what constitutes the expansion history of the Universe, and what is the state of matter in dense cores of neutron stars. This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These remarkable observations have opened up a new field of gravitational-wave astrophysics, and they are allowing the predictions of Einstein's theory of relativity to be tested in new ways for these dynamic and strongly gravitating binaries. Much remains to be learned from these novel observations. Through a better understanding of the predictions of Einstein's theory and through more precise calculations of the emitted gravitational waves, more of the scientific potential of these observations will be tapped. This project, therefore, outlines a research program to use a combination of foundational computations, as well as analytical and numerical modeling of black holes and neutron stars, to aid in extracting insights from gravitational-wave observations. Many of the calculations will be carried out by graduate students, who will be trained in techniques that are useful in physics research and other quantitative areas. A final component of the project involves the development of visualizations that are intended for a broad audience of non-scientists, which aim to make the generation of gravitational waves more intuitive and accessible.<br/><br/>More specifically, the research goals of this project will be to make advances in gravitational physics on two fronts: (i) to investigate and compute the part of the gravitational waveform that is strongly constrained by the symmetries and conserved quantities of isolated radiating systems, and (ii) to compute gravitational waveforms from a range of black-hole binaries that can be used to look for deviations from relativity because of the presence of matter or the modification of the underlying gravitational theory. The main goals of direction (i) are first, to compute gravitational waveforms associated with gravitational-wave memory effects that can be evaluated rapidly; second, to understand discrepancies between two commonly used definitions of angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes; and third, to compute generalized notions of memory effects in these spacetimes. For direction (ii), there are three different objectives: for the first, investigating the influence of dense distributions of matter on the gravitational waveforms from black-hole binaries with mass ratios that differ greatly from one; for the second, to explore how modifications to general relativity affect the gravitational-wave memory effect; and for the last, approximating the gravitational waveform in modified gravity theories using a combination of perturbative expansions. The outreach aims of this project revolve around creating visualizations of the warped spacetime of binaries radiating gravitational waves. The visualizations will highlight the physical stretching and squeezing effects of gravitational waves and illustrate how gravitational waves are generated. Animations of these visualizations will be posted online and could also be used as pedagogical tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first direct detection of gravitational waves emitted from merging black holes, by the NSF's LIGO detectors, was a historic breakthrough in gravitational physics, and led to the Noble prize in physics in 2017. Equally stunning was the detection of both gravitational waves and signal across the electromagnetic spectrum from gamma rays to radio waves, from the inspiral and merger of two neutron stars. With these and numerous subsequent similar detections a new window to the universe has been opened. More detections from a variety of other astrophysical sources are also anticipated. This project aims at making predictions about compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars, by running numerical simulations of the basic equations that govern such very dense and exotic objects. For this purpose a new computer program called Nmesh is being developed. Nmesh will be run on large scale supercomputers that nowadays consist of millions of compute cores. Making full and efficient use of so many cores involves various advanced programming techniques to run Nmesh in parallel. While the primary and immediate scientific goal of this project is the simulation of black holes and neutron stars, Nmesh can also be used to simulate other types of equations. Once it is well tested, Nmesh will be made publicly available. This will directly benefit other researchers in the area of numerical relativity, but since Nmesh is quite general it should also benefit others that need to solve different problems that are governed by different equations. Part of the research will be carried out in close collaboration with the relativity group at the University of Jena in Germany. Visits by faculty and students from both institutions are planned. This exchange will have educational benefits for students from both Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and the University of Jena.<br/><br/>This project mainly focuses on binaries made up of black holes or neutron stars. When the two objects get close, fully non-linear numerical simulations of the Einstein equations are required to make predictions about the final part of the inspiral and subsequent merger. The project is aimed at gaining a detailed understanding of such compact-object binary inspirals and mergers by performing numerical simulations. Using the Nmesh program it will provide gravitational waveform catalogs, as well as information about ejecta when matter is involved. To achieve high accuracy results it is thus planned to further develop and upgrade Nmesh. This will enable the study of high mass ratio black hole inspirals, as well as binary neutron star simulations with improved accuracy. The results will also be used to improve and calibrate analytical waveform models to predict gravitational waves without needing to perform expensive numerical simulations. The upgrades to Nmesh will not only include advanced parallelization methods, but will also include the development of methods to treat shocks, within the framework of discontinuous Galerkin methods. The latter method is still new in numerical relativity, and thus requires special attention.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has opened up a new window in astronomy, enabling a deeper understanding of the physics of relativity through the study of merging BHs, the objects that bend space and time the most.  Since these interactions are so complicated, powerful computer simulations are needed to interpret the science.  A collaboration between research groups at the University of Mississippi and Pennsylvania State University will develop and run computer models to better understand the formation and development of compact binary star systems and to more effectively use the rich information from gravitational waves to probe these systems. A related effort is the development of methods to use GW in the future to study dark matter. The research team will also promote scientific literacy by providing astronomy lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on activities to school children and adult citizenry in economically disadvantaged communities in the state of Mississippi and the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. <br/><br/>The investigators will carry out two closely related projects to model the gravitational wave astrophysics of compact binary systems. The first project concerns the astrophysical information that can be extracted from the characteristic signature imposed on a gravitational wave signal due to the spin and the orbital precession of coalescing black hole binaries. The team will introduce spin dynamics into compact binary evolution models and track the evolution of BH binaries from formation through merger, including effects such as an initial supernova kick, mass transfer and spin-orbit coupling. An offshoot of this work is to investigate bounds on ultra-light bosonic dark matter though its possible GW signature. The second project will involve inferring compact binary population models from a catalog of gravitational wave observations. The team will put together a database of evolutionary models and work to distinguish between the predicted observables of the various models. Goals include understanding the distribution of BH masses, spins, and merger rates and the properties of the stochastic GW background.

The LIGO and VIRGO gravitational wave detectors are beginning to make new discoveries on a weekly basis. The gravitational waves that they detect are generated in the mergers of two compact objects, such as black holes or neutron stars. Gravitational waves carry important information about their origin that can extracted through careful comparisons to theoretical calculations, such as full-scale computer simulations of binary mergers. This project will study mergers of binary neutron stars and black holes using computer simulations created by Dendro-GR, a new computer code that runs very efficiently on the largest supercomputers.  This work will also help push forward current computational capabilities to permit better and faster waveform calculations to be made. These efforts will aid in expanding the use of gravitational wave detections from confirming general relativity to providing additional, even more stringent tests of both the theory and other possible competing theories.  Combining data from computer simulations with both gravitational and electromagnetic observations will allow us to probe, in a manner heretofore impossible, the physics of black holes and neutron stars, of gamma-ray bursts, of kilonovae and supernovae, and of even the formation of the heaviest elements on the periodic table. Work done for this project will promote the progress of science and contribute to undergraduate and graduate training in multiple STEM fields including computer science, mathematics, and physics. Finally, Dendro-GR is an open source project.<br/><br/>The overarching purpose of this project is to study the dynamics of merging binary compact objects at the frontier of current computational capabilities.  The wavelet-based refinement and computational efficiency of Dendro-GR allows the modeling of a wider variety of possible merger scenarios, enhancing the ability to both detect and understand these high-energy events, as well as search for possible new physics beyond our current gravitational models.  The efforts will be directed primarily at the following goals:  (1) Deploying new computational algorithms and abilities to determine gravitational waveforms for binary neutron star inspirals and mergers of sufficient accuracy that they are usable in improved waveform catalogs.  (2)  Investigating binary black hole inspirals and mergers with large mass ratios both to understand this class of largely unexplored binaries and to expand the range of current waveform catalogs.

The present project seeks to contribute to filling this gap by incorporating new ideas in quantum gravity to cosmology. The goal of this project is twofold: to extend our understanding of the origin and fate of the universe, and to use the last generation of cosmological observations to test recent developments in quantum-gravity. Additionally, this award supports several educational initiatives that enhance the teaching of cosmology at graduate and undergraduate levels through the creation of new courses as well as outreach projects in coordination with the LIGO Science Education Center.<br/><br/>This award supports research aimed at developing theoretical methods to incorporate quantum gravity physics in models of the early universe. Investigations will focus on theoretical as well as phenomenological aspects of quantum cosmology, with special emphasis on techniques coming from loop quantum gravity. From the theoretical point of view, it will be explored how matter fields propagate on regimes where quantum aspects of gravity are important, and the way in which the familiar quantum field theory in curved space-times emerges from the more fundamental theory. From the phenomenological viewpoint, the resulting theoretical framework will be applied to extend cosmological models to include Planck scale physics. Investigations will cover scalar perturbations that are responsible for the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and galaxy distribution, non-Gaussianity, primordial magnetic fields, and gravitational waves generated in the early universe. Attention will also be paid to find mechanisms to account for some anomalies recently observed in cosmic microwave background. The results of this project are expected to reinforce the bridge between quantum gravity and cosmology, producing benefits for both fields."

The main goal of the meeting is to discuss the science and R&D requirements for the next generation of ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors and the different options for the governance of a global detector network. Dozens of US scientists are now involved in a study commissioned by the Gravitational Wave International Committee (GWIC) to assess the scientific merit of building detectors on the ground that are 10 to 30 times more sensitive than advanced detectors. DAWN IV is a critical meeting for people involved in this study.<br/><br/>LIGO and Virgo discoveries of binary black hole and binary neutron star mergers in the past three years have already begun to make a huge impact in our understanding of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology.

Waves, such as water, sound, elastic and electromagnetic waves, are a prominent feature of physical systems. Previous work on this project involved international experts spanning applied mathematics, computation, gravitational theory and astrophysics and led to new methods which have found application to a broad class of problems, e.g. seismology. In a historic scientific event leading to a Nobel prize award, gravitational waves were recently detected by a Laser Interferometric Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO). This initial detection was a resounding  confirmation of Einstein's theory. In collaboration with the European Virgo gravitational wave observatory, it opens a new form of astronomy which will expand our knowledge of the universe. The powerful gravitational waves in the initial detection resulted from the inspiral and merger  of two co-orbiting black holes. The excitement generated by this dramatic event has led to overflow audiences at public lectures and has inspired young talent to enter the field.<br/><br/>Although Einstein's equations describe the production of gravitational waves, their complexity and nonlinearity make a purely analytic  approach inadequate. This necessitated the introduction of computational methods into general relativity.  A main goal of the project is to develop new methods for computing the gravitational waveform and other physical properties of binary black hole inspirals, such as the energy-momentum and angular momentum loss. The approach utilizes characteristic evolution based upon the light cones on which the radiation propagates. Most computational work is based upon time evolution using the Cauchy initial value problem. The reformulation of the initial value problem for general relativity in terms of light cones by Bondi and by Penrose resulted in the first clear understanding of gravitational radiation. Characteristic evolution has led to the first code which could successfully locate, track, evolve and compute the waveform for a single distorted, spinning and moving black hole. However, the focusing of the light cones in a  binary problem leads to interior caustics which prevent a purely characteristic approach. On the other hand, present Cauchy codes require a finite artificial outer boundary which introduces ambiguity and error in extracting the waveform. The global strategy pursued here combines Cauchy evolution in the interior region containing the black holes with characteristic evolution in the exterior region extending along the light cones to infinity. This integrates the complementary strengths of Cauchy and characteristic evolution and has led to a characteristic wave extraction tool which is available to the numerical relativity community as part of the Einstein Toolkit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A number of detector systems are                        currently in various stages of planning and development both                    here and abroad.  Notable among these is the LIGO detector,                     recently funded by Congress, which is expected to be                            operational before the end of this decade.  On the theoretical                  side, much activity is focused on calculating the                               gravitational waveforms expected from various sources.                          Understanding many of the most interesting sources is believed                  to require large scale numerical simulations.

The Eulerian code                  will study stellar collapse and rotational instabilities,                       while the fully Lagrangian code will model the collision and                    coalescence of neutron stars.  Both codes will use Newtonian                    and post-Newtonian gravity including gravitational radiation                    reaction.  The development of two independent codes will allow                  cross-checking and intercomparison of results; this is                          important to verify that the codes produce the correct                          physical behavior.

Numerous models exist for describing such systems, such as post-Newtonian, phenomenological, Effective One Body ones, and numerical simulations of the full Einstein equations (the field of numerical relativity). Regardless of the model to describe it, the problem suffers from a fairly large dimensionality. Roughly speaking, the number of configurations to study is too large for an exhaustive analysis. For this reason, large regions of the  parameter space have been so far unexplored. Under this award, we will engage in a systematic study of the physical parameter space for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences (CBC) using a Reduced Basis approach. Reduced Basis will be used for efficiently selecting within certain physical models for CBC the most relevant regions in parameter space to solve for and analyze, compactly representing the corresponding gravitational waves, and predicting new ones based on such selection. <br/><br/>Reduced Basis modeling is an active area of basic and applied research at the forefront of many fields, from climate studies and weather forecasting to gene classification and hyperspectral imaging. We envision that the techniques we will develop in our gravitational physics research will also find application in other fields.

Interferometric gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO and its partners have reached design sensitivity. The general consensus is that first detections will take place in the very near future. Beyond detection, one of the grand challenges in this new astronomy is the characterization of sources from the information encoded in the signals buried in the noisy data. The degree of success in this enterprise will determine the extent to which gravitational wave observations can be used as a tool of discovery. The proposed project is motivated by the premise that recognizing and interpreting the data collected through the window of gravitational wave observations requires a set of skills spanning several disciplines, thus presenting an opportunity to develop transformative and multidisciplinary research and to open the door to innovations and advances in this new astronomy, in which gravitational waves act as messengers. <br/><br/>The central theme of this project is using numerical-relativity tools and data-analysis methodologies to solve the inverse problem in gravitational physics for one of the most important sources of gravitational radiation, the inspiral and merger of a binary black hole system. The solution to this problem is essential for harnessing the predictive power of general relativity and for enhancing the conversation between the data collected by gravitational wave interferometric detectors and the questions posed by astrophysics.  <br/><br/>The project approach is development of efficient numerical algorithms for assimilating observational data, applying deterministic and stochastic parameter estimation techniques to address the source characterization problem. Activities supported by this proposal are intended to produce tools and methodologies that enable the marriage of numerical simulation, gravitational wave observation and algorithms used in large inverse problems outside gravitational physics. These tools will enable acquiring new knowledge through the analysis of large and rich multi-spectral gravitational observations, multi-scale numerical relativity simulations, catalyzed by the combination of the still-growing pool of computational resources and related advances in the understanding of computational Bayesian inference. <br/><br/>Among its broader impacts, this multidisciplinary team intends to develop a new paradigm for using numerical relativity tools and an innovative approach to the inverse problem in gravitational physics. The tools produced by this collaboration will be made freely available and will be directly applicable to other disciplines. The proposed work exploits algorithms and methodology to tackle inverse problems in areas such as global climate change, weather forecasting, medical imaging and reservoir simulations. Students will have opportunities to build expertise in data analysis, numerical algorithms, high-performance computing, optimization, and inverse problems."

Once operating at their optimal design sensitivities, these detectors are expected to open a new vista in high-energy astrophysics, gravitational wave astronomy, in which gravitational radiation incident on Earth could be analyzed to extract previously inaccessible information about its sources.  A great deal of work must yet be done to make gravitational wave astronomy a reality.  This award sponsors the development of mathematical techniques needed to calculate approximations to the gravitational wave signals arising from an astrophysical in-spiral of pairs of black holes or neutron stars.  These are likely to be among the strongest signals for detection and are consequently among the most critical to understand theoretically.  The research funded here will be conducted in concert with three other groups around the U.S., and will tightly integrate the development of new mathematical techniques and the generation of computer codes implementing them.  In addition to the main goal of <br/>producing a reliable template for the gravitational wave signal arising from binary systems, this work aims to produce new, astrophysically-realistic initial-data sets describing binary systems for other numerical relativity efforts around the country and around the world.<br/><br/>The mathematical terrain underlying this project is largely unexplored.   As a result, there are many educational opportunities for under-graduate and graduate students participating in this work.  <br/>Students need little preparation beyond their course work to begin contributing, and the chance to become involved in timely and important research in relativity theory --- a prominent sub-field of physics in the popular imagination --- could help attract young people to the field.  In addition, this research will be conducted by a young PI in a young relativity effort at a young research institution, Florida Atlantic University.  The award will help establish a new group in gravitational theory and foster close research ties between it and established groups around the U.S.  This new group will help raise the profile of physics research, particularly in relativity theory, throughout southern Florida via its members' planned vigorous public outreach efforts.<br/>"

The LIGO/Virgo Scientific Collaboration has compiled an impressive list of detected gravitational wave (GW) events consisting of several dozen binary black hole (BHBH) mergers, a couple of binary neutron star (NSNS) mergers and several likely black hole--neutron star (BHNS) mergers. These detections mark the beginning of the era of GW astronomy. This research project spans several problems involving general relativity (GR), the generation of GWs, relativistic hydrodynamics, and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. A common thread uniting the different theoretical topics is the crucial role of gravitation, especially relativistic gravitation. Compact objects (black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs) provide the principal forum, and the dynamics of matter in a strong gravitational field is a major theme. Some of the topics for investigation include the inspiral and coalescence of compact binaries (BHBHs, NSNSs and BHNSs); the generation of GWs from merging binaries and other promising astrophysical sources, and their counterpart electromagnetic (EM) signals; gravitational collapse; the stability of rotating, relativistic stars and the evolution and final fate of unstable stars; gamma-ray burst sources (GRBs); the formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) from the magnetorotational collapse of supermassive stars (SMSs) and other scenarios; circumbinary disks around merging binary SMBHs in the cores of galaxies and quasars; and the profiles and observable signatures of dark matter around SMBHs in galaxy cores, including the Milky Way, and the dynamical evolution of clusters containing DM, stars and SMBHs.  The results have important implications for astronomical observations, including those collected by and/or planned for GW interferometers.<br/><br/>Most of these topics represent long-standing, fundamental problems in theoretical physics requiring large-scale computation for solution. Hence the approach involves to a significant degree large-scale simulations on supercomputers, in addition to analytical modeling. The key tool will be the robust and well-tested Illinois general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code. The simulations solve Einstein's field equations of GR for gravity coupled to the equations of relativistic MHD for the fluid and Maxwell's equations for the EM fields. These equations constitute highly nonlinear, coupled partial differential equations in 3+1 dimensions that are solved by finite-differencing. The Illinois GRMHD code employs the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) technique with moving puncture gauge conditions and adaptive moving mesh refinement to solve the field equations and a high-resolution, shock capturing scheme for the MHD. The problems to be tackled comprise both initial value and evolution computations and treat vacuum spacetimes containing black holes, as well as spacetimes containing realistic matter sources, magnetic fields and both EM and neutrino radiation (""multimessenger astronomy""). The research and outreach activities supported by this grant help promote the use of computers and visualization tools at all levels of education, as well as the public awareness of some the latest and most exciting developments in gravitational physics and astrophysics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events have revealed new astrophysics, including confirming the process through which heavy elements are created and discovering a new class of heavy stellar-mass black holes, and are providing novel tests of general relativity theory.  They also herald eventual gravitational wave observations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a stellar-mass black hole or neutron star spirals into a supermassive black hole, such as those now known to exist in the center of virtually all large galaxies.  Surrounded by dense star clusters, these supermassive black holes will frequently capture compact stars (e.g., neutrons stars or stellar mass black holes) into highly eccentric orbits.  As these compact stars orbit, they radiate gravitational waves, causing the orbit to decay and the compact object to eventually be swallowed by the supermassive black hole. The emitted gravitational radiation is potentially observable with LISA, the future space-based gravitational wave detector.  The theoretical work funded by this award will provide improved predictions of the expected signals from highly-eccentric compact merging binaries.  Detection of gravitational waves from such EMRIs will provide unique strong field tests of gravity and probe the nature of black holes.<br/><br/>To pursue this effort, development of new techniques in black hole perturbation theory and gravitational self-force methods will be made, along with writing associated advanced computer codes.  High precision results from perturbation theory and self-force calculations will be studied to uncover high-order terms in the post-Newtonian expansion of eccentric binary motion and associated gravitational wave emission.  Perturbation theory and self-force findings in the extreme-mass-ratio, post-Newtonian overlap region support and reinforce broader efforts to advance post-Newtonian theory to higher orders and provide calibrations for effective-one-body models of merging binaries.  The PI's group is extending self-force calculations to generic motion on Kerr backgrounds, using a scalar field model initially, with primary focus to make these computations more efficient.  New self-force techniques will be combined with osculating elements codes to build long-term inspiral models for eccentric EMRIs.  Some parts of this work will be conducted in external collaboration with several former students and with colleagues at University College Dublin.

To realize the full scientific potential of current and future gravitational wave experiments, a model of the expected gravitational wave signal must be both highly accurate and very fast to evaluate. This award will support a multi-disciplinary approach to gravitational-wave science, drawing on collaborations with physicists, mathematicians, and data scientists to produce new algorithms and computer programs aimed at maximizing the scientific output of gravitational wave observations. This award, and more generally discoveries made with gravitational waves, will continue to engage the public through outreach efforts. Students funded through this award will be trained with a strong STEM background and will be well prepared for careers that require technical and computational skills. <br/><br/>This award will support the development, implementation, and use of numerical techniques designed to overcome some of the most urgent challenges in gravitational wave data science. Crucially, the interpretation of gravitational wave datasets requires access to a model which is both fast-to-evaluate and faithful to the relevant physics. Using traditional techniques, these two requirements are often at odds with one another. Recently, a set of targeted numerical tools has emerged as a means to ameliorate, or in some cases overcome entirely, these bottlenecks. For large-scale relativistic astrophysics simulations, the key developments have been towards accurate and robust numerical methods and novel parallelization strategies that will afford unprecedented simulation accuracy. A different set of tools has been developed to construct surrogate models that are able to accurately reproduce numerical relativity waveforms at arbitrary parameter values within a fraction of a second. The goal of this project is to build on these recent successes and to (i) continue the development of these numerical methods by extending them to handle more challenging cases, (ii) implement these methods and models within existing public codes so that they are widely available, and (iii) carry out high-impact scientific studies made possible by the rapid, high-fidelity numerical models and simulation codes that have been built.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first is gravitational-wave astronomy from inspiral of double neutron-star (NS-NS) systems and black-hole-neutron-star (BH-NS) systems. One goal is to use gravitational wave observations from binary inspirals to measure parameters of the neutron-star equation of state (EOS). A collaboration with three numerical relativity groups will compute the gravitational waves produced in the late inspiral of double neutron-star systems, use the waveforms to analyze the way in which gravitational- wave observations will constrain the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear density, and find the accuracy with which equation-of-state and neutron-star parameters can be extracted. The study of BH-NS inspiral is still in its early stage, with the wide range of black hole masses and spins still to be explored. Computer simulations will explore the late inspiral and merger of systems with varying mass ratios and black hole spins, including spins oblique to the orbital plane. The second project will examine extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral (EMRI). A principal goal of the planned NASA/ESA space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA, is to observe gravitational waves from the inspiral of stellar-size black holes orbiting supermassive black holes (the EMRIs). To maximize the number of observed events and, more critically, to extract from the observations the characteristics of the sources, it is essential to obtain accurate waveforms associated with generic orbits. Because the ratio of the component masses is small, the orbits and gravitational waves from these binary systems can be described to high accuracy by a perturbative expansion. Finding the conservative part of the self force, a correction needed for parameter extraction, may be the most difficult part of the problem, but it can be regarded as a correction to an inspiral described by the dissipative radiation-reaction force on a particle in near-geodesic orbit. <br/><br/>Understanding the waveforms from binary inspiral and their implications for gravitational-wave astronomy is a critical part of the nation's substantial commitment to the LIGO and to the planned space-based observatory, LISA. With support from funds from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Research Growth Initiative, from a University Scholarship, and from the present NSF grant, graduate students and a post-doctoral research associate will gain expertise in areas of gravitational physics, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity that will be fundamental to the development of gravitational-wave astronomy."

One project examines the evolution of spacetimes to see if the development of singularities that signal the breakdown of GR can occur in nature only inside black holes and, within black holes, can be visible only to observers who run into them. This is called the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. This question will be addressed through continued development of lightcone estimates for the Einstein equations that parallel those that have already been developed for the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations. The objective will be to show that spacetime curvature cannot blow up (pointwise) in a (vacuum) solution to Einstein's equations until the integrated (Bel-Robinson) energy for curvature blows up. Another project will be to continue the development of improved numerical methods for the study of black hole collisions. Recent work has established the regularity of the (conformally transformed) ADM evolution equations at null infinity. This result and its potential generalizations will be applied to actual numerical calculations.<br/><br/>The cosmic censorship conjecture is often considered to be the main open mathematical problem in classical general relativity. Cosmic censorship is the natural analogue, for Einstein's equations, of the global existence property for Minkowski space field theories and so it seems very plausible that techniques that have proven successful in the analysis of the latter should have something important to contribute to the former. In addition, any significant progress on the development of improved numerical methods for the analysis of black hole collisions can be anticipated to strongly influence the ongoing worldwide efforts to numerically model these important astrophysical processes and ultimately to impact LIGO and LISA observations. Much of this research should be of interest to mathematicians. Development of improved numerical methods for the computation of gravitational waves from colliding black holes could have an impact on the experimental search for such radiation. Postdoctoral fellows and graduate students are expected to play key roles in these projects."

The ultimate goal of this project<br/>is to collect the data from some of the NSF-funded large<br/>cyberinfrastructure projects, such as NEES, LIGO, XSEDE, and NRAO.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this planning project is to collect requirements<br/>from potential praticipants (both users and contributors of data sets)<br/>and seed a prototype repository with data sets from two of the largest<br/>and latest clusters at Purdue. The data sets will comprise static<br/>information, dynamic information about the workloads, and failure<br/>information, for both planned and unplanned outages.<br/><br/>The broader impact in the project will be achieved through the<br/>dissemination of the data sets to a wide variety of researchers, and<br/>perhaps even, practitioners. The datasets will let people run their<br/>campus clusters more efficiently, i.e., with fewer failures, at higher<br/>utilization and energy efficiency.<br/><br/>"

The goal of XSEDE is to accelerate open scientific discovery by enhancing the productivity and capability of researchers, engineers, and scholars, and by broadening their participation in science and engineering. It does so by making advanced computational resources easier to use, integrating existing resources into new, powerful services and building the community of users and providers. XSEDE is a virtual organization that provisions complex distributed infrastructure, support services, and technical expertise. A prominent opportunity for XSEDE is the growing, diverse collection of advanced computing, high-end visualization, data analysis, and other resources and services available to researchers, engineers, and scholars; these resources have the potential to help understand and solve the most important and challenging problems facing the nation and world. The challenge for XSEDE, as a virtual organization, is to organize these disparate resources, creating integrated services and a coordinated environment that serves the end user needs. The challenge also includes fostering awareness of, and training for, full utilization of the capabilities offered by XSEDE and its associated resources, as well as catalyzing workforce developments. All these tasks need to be accomplished in light of evolving user requirements, resources, and NSF strategies.<br/><br/>The XSEDE 2 project will be executed by the principal investigator (PI) and staff of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and by the co-PIs and staff of the partner organizations at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC, Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh), San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC, University of California San Diego), and Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC, University of Texas at Austin), as well as 15 other partner organizations.<br/><br/>For the next five years, in pursuit of its overall goals of enhancing user productivity and broadening participation of the CDS&E community, XSEDE 2 will provide an adaptive and streamlined framework that anticipates the opportunities afforded by advances in technology, responds to users' abilities to make effective use of new capabilities, and enables the current and next generation in using these technologies to advance their fields. The three strategic goals remain unchanged from the original XSEDE project:<br/><br/>* To deepen and extend use of the ecosystem of national cyberinfrastructure (CI) by both existing computational researchers and new communities of scientists and students where the use of computation and large-scale data is transforming their respective fields;<br/>* To advance the national CI ecosystem by creating an open and evolving infrastructure, and by enhancing the array of technical expertise and support services offered; and<br/>* To sustain the national CI ecosystem by maintaining a secure, reliable and efficient infrastructure.<br/><br/>XSEDE 2 will reorganize into five goal-driven focus areas that will provide a more agile and responsive program designed to accelerate progress toward the strategic goals:<br/><br/>* The Resource Allocation Service (RAS), led by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and four other partners, will continue to manage the process of receiving, evaluating and awarding proposals for computational resources. In doing so, it will fulfill XSEDE 2's crucial role of neutral arbiter in allocating resources from the service-provider ecosystem to the research community. RAS will also identify new opportunities for allocation innovations by increased transparency, open reporting of user trends, and adapting the allocation process to new technologies.<br/>* The revised XSEDE Community Infrastructure (XCI) service, led by Cornell University and six other partners, will identify, evaluate, test, and make available new software capabilities. Governance is in place to ensure that these activities are driven by the needs of both users and providers of cyberinfrastructure.<br/>* Community Engagement & Enrichment (CEE), led by the University of Texas and 12 other partners, will build on the XSEDE tradition of outstanding user services, and engage a new generation of diverse computational researchers. In addition to education, training, and outreach activities, CEE will connect to campus HPC communities, to help researchers access both local and national resources.<br/>* The Extended Collaborative Support Service (ECSS), led by the San Diego Supercomputer Center, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and eight other partners, will maximize the effectiveness of HPC resources through its large staff of computational experts who will directly participate in research teams, providing advanced assistance to science projects.<br/>* Finally, XSEDE Operations, led by the University of Tennessee and five other partners, will maintain and evolve an integrated HPC capability of national scale. Operations provides a ""one-stop-shop"" experience for users across the XSEDE-coordinated HPC ecosystem.<br/><br/>While continuity in providing these services is essential for the large and further-growing user community, XSEDE 2 will also respond to the evolving needs and opportunities of science and technology. To this end, XSEDE 2 will develop novel ways to connect to and collaborate with other national, regional and campus cyberinfrastructure organizations. The project will continue to innovate the use of ""e-science portals"" (also known as Science Gateways). Science gateways provide interfaces and services that are customized to a domain science and have an increasing role with facilities and research centers, collaborating on large research undertakings (e.g., Advanced LIGO, Polar Geospatial Center). This approach facilitates broad community access to advanced compute and data resources. Science gateways are now serving more than 50% of the user community. XSEDE 2 will also incorporate new methods to serve users interested in cloud computing resources and big-data projects. Furthermore, by analyzing trends in usage and technology, the renewal project will be even better positioned to respond to the evolving needs of its stakeholders and to emerging opportunities in new compute and data resources."

Interferometric gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO and its partners have reached design sensitivity. The general consensus is that first detections will take place in the very near future. Beyond detection, one of the grand challenges in this new astronomy is the characterization of sources from the information encoded in the signals buried in the noisy data. The degree of success in this enterprise will determine the extent to which gravitational wave observations can be used as a tool of discovery. The proposed project is motivated by the premise that recognizing and interpreting the data collected through the window of gravitational wave observations requires a set of skills spanning several disciplines, thus presenting an opportunity to develop transformative and multidisciplinary research and to open the door to innovations and advances in this new astronomy, in which gravitational waves act as messengers. <br/><br/>The central theme of this project is using numerical-relativity tools and data-analysis methodologies to solve the inverse problem in gravitational physics for one of the most important sources of gravitational radiation, the inspiral and merger of a binary black hole system. The solution to this problem is essential for harnessing the predictive power of general relativity and for enhancing the conversation between the data collected by gravitational wave interferometric detectors and the questions posed by astrophysics.  <br/><br/>The project approach is development of efficient numerical algorithms for assimilating observational data, applying deterministic and stochastic parameter estimation techniques to address the source characterization problem. Activities supported by this proposal are intended to produce tools and methodologies that enable the marriage of numerical simulation, gravitational wave observation and algorithms used in large inverse problems outside gravitational physics. These tools will enable acquiring new knowledge through the analysis of large and rich multi-spectral gravitational observations, multi-scale numerical relativity simulations, catalyzed by the combination of the still-growing pool of computational resources and related advances in the understanding of computational Bayesian inference. <br/><br/>Among its broader impacts, this multidisciplinary team intends to develop a new paradigm for using numerical relativity tools and an innovative approach to the inverse problem in gravitational physics. The tools produced by this collaboration will be made freely available and will be directly applicable to other disciplines. The proposed work exploits algorithms and methodology to tackle inverse problems in areas such as global climate change, weather forecasting, medical imaging and reservoir simulations. Students will have opportunities to build expertise in data analysis, numerical algorithms, high-performance computing, optimization, and inverse problems."

Instead of maturing through their birth, middle age and death alone, they live their lives with one or more companion stars.  ""Binary stars"", where two stars progress through their life cycle together, are the most common form of multiple star systems.  The investigators seek to understand the final stages of the binary star life cycle, where the smaller star plunges into the atmosphere of the larger one leading to the spectacular phenomena called Common Envelope Evolution (CEE).  The CEE stage is one of the most difficult to understand and one of the most important stages of the binary star life cycle.  It is important because many of the Universe?s strangest and most exotic phenomena come from the Common Envelope stage.  The most famous recent example of a CEE event was the Black Hole-Black Hole merger, which made headlines across the world after being observed via gravitational waves with the NSF funded LIGO project.<br/><br/>Modeling CEE requires the most sophisticated supercomputer simulations because the process is so violent and occurs so quickly.   The investigators will use a newly developed supercomputer code to reveal new details of CEE and resolve long-standing mysteries about how the binary stars quickly shrink their orbit and drive huge amounts of material into space.  Their work will be closely tied to observations via their codes' ability to produce ""synthetic observations"" that can be directly compared with what is seen on the sky.

In domains as crucial to our society as climate modeling, oceanography, particle physics, seismology, or computational biology (and in fact in most fields of physics, chemistry, and biology today), scientists nowadays routinely define ""scientific workflows"". These workflows are complex descriptions of scientific processes as data and inter-dependent computations on these data. When executed, typically with great expenses of computing, storage, and networking hardware, these workflows can produce groundbreaking results. A famous and recent example is the workflow that was used as part of the LIGO project to confirm the first detection of gravitational waves from colliding black holes. Scientific workflows are mainstays in today's science. Their efficient  execution (in terms of speed, reliability, and cost) is thus crucial. This project seeks to provide a software framework, called WRENCH (Workflow Simulation Workbench), that will make it possible to simulate large-scale hypothetical scenarios quickly and accurately on a single computer, obviating the need for expensive and time-consuming trial and error experiments. WRENCH potentially enables scientists to make quick and informed choices when executing their workflows, software developers to implement more efficient software infrastructures to support workflows, and researchers to develop novel efficient algorithms to be embedded within these software infrastructures.  In addition, WRENCH makes it possible to bring scientific workflow content into undergraduate and graduate computer science curricula. This is because meaningful knowledge can be gained by students using a single computer and the WRENCH software stack, making such learning possible even at institutions without access to high-end computing infrastructures, such as many non-Ph.D.-granting and minority-serving institutions. As a result, this work will contribute to producing computer science graduates better equipped to take an active role in the advancing of science.  Due to its potentially transformative impact on scientific workflow usage, development, research, and education, this project promises to promote the progress of science across virtually all its fields, ultimately resulting in broad and numerous benefits to our society.<br/><br/>Scientific workflows have become mainstream for conducting large-scale scientific research.  As a result, many workflow applications and Workflow Management Systems (WMSs) have been developed as part of the cyberinfrastructure to allow scientists to execute their applications seamlessly on a range of distributed platforms.  In spite of many success stories, building large-scale workflows and orchestrating their executions efficiently (in terms of performance, reliability, and cost) remains a challenge given the complexity of the workflows themselves and the complexity of the underlying execution platforms.  A fundamental necessary next step is the establishment of a solid ""experimental science"" approach for future workflow technology development. Such an approach is useful for scientists who need to design workflows and pick execution platforms, for WMS developers who need to compare alternate design and implementation options, and for researchers who need to develop novel decision-making algorithms to be implemented as part of WMSs.  The broad objective of this work is to provide foundational software, the Workflow Simulation Workbench (WRENCH), upon which to develop the above experimental science approach.  Capitalizing on recent advances in distributed application and platform simulation technology, WRENCH makes it possible to (i) quickly prototype workflow, WMS implementations, and decision-making algorithms; and (ii) evaluate/compare alternative options scalably and accurately for arbitrary, and often hypothetical, experimental scenarios.  This project will define a generic and foundational software architecture, that is informed by current state-of-the-art WMS designs and planned future designs.  The implementation of the components in this architecture when taken together form a generic ""scientific instrument"" that can be used by workflow users, developers, and researchers.  This scientific instrument will be instantiated for several real-world WMSs and used for a range of real-world workflow applications. In a particular case-study, it will be used with a popular WMS (Pegasus) to revisit published results and scheduling algorithms in the area of workflow planning optimizations. The objective is to demonstrate the benefit of using an experimental science approach for WMS research.  Another impact of this project is that it  makes it possible to include scientific workflow content pervasively in undergraduate and graduate computer science curricula, even for students without any access to computing infrastructure, by defining meaningful pedagogic activities that only require a computer and the WRENCH software stack. This educational impact will be demonstrated in the classroom in both undergraduate and graduate courses at our institutions."

Einstein's theory of general relativity describes how the spacetime is curved by gravitation. The language of his theory is geometry and the phenomenon is governed by his eponymous equation. There have been great advances in both theoretical and experimental aspects of general relativity, for example the recent detection of gravitational waves by LIGO. However, due to the complexity of Einstein's equation, most of our knowledge of the universe are global and large scale, such as the observation of an astrophysical event from a very faraway distance. Recently, the PI and his collaborators applied the tools of geometry and differential equations to give the most precise measurement of gravitational energy and mass on any finitely extended region of the universe. This is essential in understanding the fine and local structure of our universe, with applications in, for example, GPS technology and space exploration. It is also crucial in studying non-isolated large-scale phenomena such as black hole mergers and collisions. The success of this project will deepen our understanding of gravitational energy/mass and the nonlinear local/global nature of the spacetime. The PI also plans to study geometric flows, which are differential equations that model how a geometric shape deforms and evolves to an optimal form in the most efficient way. The PI has been engaging himself in educating a diversified body of graduate students and young researchers, and the project will be instrumental for his continued efforts along this direction.<br/><br/>The PI plans to resolve several outstanding problems in general relativity and geometric flows by the method of geometric analysis.  In particular, the quasilocal mass definition the PI discovered with Yau will be a key ingredient in this research. Immediate goals include proving the general invariant mass conjecture, establishing a positive mass theorem for the Robinson-Trautman spacetime and the linear stability of higher dimensional Schwarzschild spacetimes, and the solution of a conjecture of Arnol'd by the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. This research project will also advance our understanding of nonlinear partial differential systems such as the optimal isometric embedding equation, the mean curvature flow, and the Einstein equation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional astronomy has progressed from telescopes for visible light to include the full electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma-rays. Cosmic rays were discovered over a century ago, but the sources of these high energy particles from outer space remain mysterious. Recent discoveries by LIGO, Virgo, and IceCube have opened new windows on the Universe through gravitational waves and high energy neutrinos from deep space. Observations of these cosmic messengers have brought us into the era of Multi Messenger Astronomy (MMA). As one can imagine, multi-messenger observations with a network of a variety of detectors produce huge amounts of data with enormous complexity. Managing and analyzing the data pose a tremendous challenge to the science community, particularly those groups spread in EPSCoR states. This project will grow Big Data capability across six EPSCoR jurisdictions to address the challenge. Scientists with complementary skill sets will cooperate to make advances in MMA, beyond what could be done within a single jurisdiction. The project supports five early career faculty and trains postdoctoral scholars and college students. It also exposes secondary school students from underrepresented groups to IceCube and its Big Data challenges, which will help recruit young people into STEM fields and promote diversity and inclusion. The project?s vision is to establish a strong EPSCoR team that promotes new scientific ideas and innovates Big Data techniques to make discoveries in the era of MMA while preparing a high-tech workforce beneficial to all six participating EPSCoR states. <br/> <br/>IceCube is the world?s largest neutrino observatory serving Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (MMA). The cubic kilometer array of over 5000 optical sensors 2 km deep in the glacial ice at the South Pole and the detector array on the surface produce data at a rate of about 1 Terabyte/day. While the vast majority of the data are cosmic-ray events, among them are 10-100 neutrinos per year with energies between 10 TeV and 10 PeV. These events constitute the core of IceCube?s MMA program aiming to answer fundamental questions such as where extremely powerful cosmic accelerators reside, how they generate particles and light, and what they are made of. The next generation IceCube-Gen2 will increase the data volume by an order of magnitude and operate through 2050, to go beyond current energy limits with a much better accuracy. A full scale engagement of EPSCoR groups in IceCube and future MMA relies on overcoming impediments posed by limited infrastructure or human capital within a single jurisdiction. This project supports collaborative efforts among six EPSCoR jurisdictions to create new knowledge in three themes pivotal for IceCube?s MMA program. (1) Cosmic ray and gamma ray physics, with emphasis on separating particles from Galactic and extragalactic origins; (2) Address technical challenges in the development of radio instrumentation as part of IceCube-Gen2 by using data from the Askaryan Radio Array; (3) Develop a calibration and modeling strategy for the detection medium ice for IceCube-Gen2 by utilizing both optical and radio sensors. All these tasks will be driven by the ability to manage Big Data through advanced data science techniques in data throughput, calibration, simulation, analysis, modeling and hypothesis testing. The project is also committed to strengthen the STEM workforce across six EPSCoR jurisdictions. The workforce development plan mainly includes (i) mentoring five early career faculty, (ii) implementing a suite of programs to enhance the recruitment, retention and development of young scientists from secondary school through post-doctoral research, and (iii) developing a data science curriculum using IceCube data and research examples. The success of this project will establish a diverse, competitive, and sustainable EPSCoR team with increased research capacity to ensure that EPSCoR leverages a prominent role in IceCube?s future program and NSF's Windows on the Universe theme.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One is the ?Standard Model,? which describes all material properties with quantum particles; the other is ?General Relativity?, Einstein?s theory that describes gravitation.  Most physicists think that there must be a connection between these two theories, but to date there is no experimental signature for such a connection.  Furthermore, the discoveries of dark matter and dark energy suggest that gravitational phenomena exist that lie outside of General Relativity. The group at the University of Washington specializes in measuring ultra-feeble forces to search for unprecedentedly small deviations from gravity as described by General Relativity. While observing any deviations from General Relativity would be a revolutionary scientific discovery, it may also have consequences for future technical applications of GPS or next-generation precision clocks. Technology and technical expertise developed by this group has applications ranging from industrial metrology to earthquake prediction. Modern ideas for unifying gravity and particle physics, as well as the observation of dark energy and dark matter, suggest that some aspects of gravity remain undiscovered. The table-top experiments of the University of Washington gravity laboratory (Et-Wash Group) provide a unique opportunity to search for new physics at the intersection of General Relativity, cosmology, and particle physics. The group is a leader in the ?eld of ultra-weak force detection through technical expertise, innovation, and by responding to the most relevant timely and timeless physics questions. <br/><br/>Speci?cally, the group will:1) Test the equivalence principle (EP): It is almost certain that any connection between General Relativity and the Standard Model violates the EP. The group?s torsion balances provide the most precise EP-tests at distances below 100 km. With highly-increased sensitivity through fused silica torsion ?bers, a new EP measurement will be carried out. The experiment?s generality and relevance to cosmology will be enhanced by probing the EP with hydrogen test masses. 2) Test Newton?s Inverse-Square Law at short distances: The Et-Wash group has measured and tested gravity at distances of 41 ?m. The group will use its expertise to design and build a new instrument aimed at measuring and testing gravity down to distances of 25 ?m. 3) Advance the frontier of low-frequency ultra-small-force technology: Innovative and challenging technology development has enabled the group?s success.

One thrust of modern physics research is to gain full quantum control over increasingly complex objects.  Applications of such control include quantum information processing, quantum-controlled chemistry studies, and improved searches for dark matter and other physics beyond the Standard Model of elementary particles and fields.  Great success has been achieved in using lasers to control quantum states of trapped atoms, but it is only recently that laser techniques to control trapped molecules have become available.   In this project researchers will develop the first use of inexpensive telecom-band lasers to optically control the quantum states of a new species of molecular ion, singly-ionized Tellurium Hydride (TeH+).  This will develop new technology needed for fundamental physics studies, and it will train graduate students in atomic, molecular and optical physics research methods.<br/><br/>Besides having the right structure to allow telecom-band optical control, TeH+ is of astrophysical interest because Tellurium (Te) serves as a probe for testing models of heavy element formation in stars and was in fact observed in spectra from the recent kilonova event jointly detected by LIGO. TeH+ should be one of the most abundant Te-containing species in space, but its use as a marker first requires the observation of its spectrum in a laboratory.  TeH+ is also an attractive species for ion trap applications, not only because of the potential for inexpensive state control, but also because of its intrinsic properties. Being significantly heavier than most other molecular ions previously investigated for state control, it would have lower motional heating rates in quantum information processing applications and smaller second-order Doppler shifts in precision measurements.  Furthermore, TeH+ also has long-lived vibrational states and a deep vibrational well, making its high vibrational overtone transitions attractive candidates for optical-frequency probes of time-variation of the proton-electron mass ratio.  In this work, the researchers will produce TeH+ in a molecular beam and will perform the first experimental measurements of its spectroscopic properties.  They will then demonstrate rotational optical pumping in various schemes designed to optimize either simplicity and cost or state preparation efficiency or speed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at South Pole has recently identified a very high-energy (>PeV) neutrino and the Fermi and MAGIC observatories have identified high-energy gamma rays coincident in time and location with that neutrino.

MMA needs now to address the challenges of this increase in the amount and complexity of data that will soon be upon us, as we start around-the-clock monitoring of frequent multi-messenger events. As such, this workshop on Cyberinfrastructure (CI) for Multi-Messenger Astrophysics will provide a forum for experts in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics and Cyberinfrastracture to develop concepts for new community-scale data cyberinfrastructure for timely handling, processing, analysis, and modeling of multi-messenger astrophysical data.

This new generation of detectors will employ higher laser powers, larger test masses of low-loss materials cooled to cryogenic temperatures, and the operation at longer wavelength of the laser, among many others. High laser power and longer wavelength present a challenge for the Faraday isolators whose performance is strongly affected by the operating wavelength, requiring the current designs to be revisited.

These simulations require initial conditions: solutions to the initial value problem of general relativity for the coupled gravity-matter system. The conformal thin sandwich method is an excellent approach for solving the initial value problem; however, although not an intrinsic assumption of the method, in practice the approach has assumed conformal flatness (as have other valuable approaches). Conformal flatness yields unphysical junk radiation. By numerically constructing helically symmetric solutions to the Einstein equations, the PI will extract initial data (or conformal thin sandwich trial data) which does not rely on conformal flatness, and therefore contains the correct initial gravitational wave content. The mixed PDEs arising from the helical reduction of the Einstein equations (or their approximation in the post-Minkowski formalism) will be solved with innovative techniques: sparse modal spectral-tau methods with new preconditioning strategies. In part, these strategies may rely on randomized algorithms for the interpolative decomposition. Spectral methods deliver superb accuracy for smooth problems(neutron star spacetimes are smooth almost everywhere), and sparsity affords a fast matrix-vector multiply when using a Krylov-subspace method to iteratively solve a linear system. Whereas the preconditioning of nodal (collocation) spectral methods is well studied, less is known about modal preconditioning. Our techniques have been successfully applied to models of the binary neutron star problem. Moreover, the problem's physical structure has already been explored with different, but limited, techniques. <br/><br/>This project is to combine two sets of techniques (each already developed) and further develop the first set (spectral-tau methods), in order to obtain new results for a leading problem in gravitational wave physics. The PI will develop these mathematical methods by applying them to the specific neutron star problem described above. This strategy of specificity is often used in the development of techniques, which then prove to be more general. Because the scientific problem is of great interest, much is known about it, and results therefore exist withwhich comparisons can be made. These comparisons facilitate the development of mathematical algorithms. Conversely, new mathematical methods deliver more and/or better solutions which enhances scientific understanding."

Mergers of compact binary systems including neutron stars and black-holes of all mass ranges encode information about fundamental physics, demonstrate the behavior of matter in the most extreme environments in the Universe, give insights into the formation, acceleration and dissipation of the most powerful particle emission processes, and provide missing links in our understanding of the end stages of stellar evolution and of their astrophysical origin.

This new system will also allow the team to host a public data repository to share their results with the larger scientific community, useful for supporting further investigations, such as predicted multimessenger light curves, snapshots of ejecta structure at selected times, suitable for use as initial conditions for longer-term simulations, and tracer-particle trajectories useful for further nucleosynthesis calculations. These datasets will also be relevant for the interpretations of observations by current ground-based detectors, such as advanced LIGO, and similar detectors across the globe, future space-based gravitational wave missions, such as LISA, and upcoming major astronomical observatories such as The Vera Rubin's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).<br/><br/>This award supports the acquisition of a new data storage and analysis cluster to support multimessenger astrophysics.

The research will address a key problem in modern precision measurements in which the presence of surface-induced interactions at metallic interfaces has become one of the biggest sources of systematic errors, as noticed in the trapping and manipulation of single-atom for quantum computing, and in precise gravitational experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).

The research program will provide on-campus research opportunities for undergraduate students, enhancing an existing research program in the area of precision force measurements at Seattle University. The students will receive training in research methods for defining and addressing open-ended problems, professional ethics and conduct, and scientific reporting and communications by engaging in leading-edge research projects. The research program will expand faculty-led research opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds and is designed to lay the foundation for a long-term integrated scientific and education program in the physics department at Seattle University."

The overarching aim of these topics is to push forward our knowledge in mathematics as well as in physics. In particular, this involves geometric analysis and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with a focus on the Einstein equations in general relativity. The new insights and methods from this project will also be important to solve other structurally similar PDE, some of which are central to models in science and technology. One main branch of the PI's research concerns the Einstein equations linking the physical content of our universe to geometry, thus they give the physical laws a geometric structure. These equations are at the heart of the theory of general relativity, which governs the physics of our universe in the large. Exploring these equations will lead toa better understanding of the universe as a whole and of isolated systems such as galaxies, binary black holes or binary neutron stars.  The observation of gravitational waves by the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) project in 2015 marked the beginning of a new era where information from distant regions of our universe is decoded directly from the universe itself (rather than from electromagnetic waves like for instance light in telescopes). More than ever, synergies between mathematics, in particular analysis of PDE and geometry, physics and astrophysics are needed to unravel the new structures. The PI will build on her results to develop new methods to achieve these goals. Through the educational component of this project, the PI's research will also have direct impact in a wider sense via teaching and outreach activities.The PI will train students and postdocs in these fields, and through broad outreach activities reach members of the public including underrepresented groups. The PI will also communicate her results through publications, conferences and the internet.<br/><br/>The PI will develop and explore new mathematical methods to investigate the Einstein equations and other nonlinear PDE describing physical phenomena. In particular, the PI proposes to study: (1) the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations focussing on spacetimes with radiation; (2) the mathematics of gravitational waves and their memory effect (a permanent change of the spacetime showing as a permanent displacement of test masses in a detector like aLIGO) in general relativity,as well as analogs of memory in other physical theories; and (3) Euler equations and other PDE per se and their coupling to the Einstein equations. Whereas all these topics center around a purely mathematical (geometric-analytic) treatment, each one of them will produce results that can be directly applied in physics experiments. Parts of the suggested research will continue the PI's former work linking her mathematical insights to experiments (aLIGO in particular). It is expected that the gravitational wave memory effect will be measured in the near future. These new projects will partially build on the PI's and collaborators' recent results and methods but will also require new ideas and approaches. The PI and D. Garfinkle derived two analogs of memory in electromagnetism, thus for the first time outside of general relativity. The PI and collaborators will continue their research to complete the understanding of memory in general relativity, and to extend their research to other physical theories (e.g., quantum electrodynamics). The PI will connect this line of research with her other project about the global Cauchy problem, and she will study other PDE with geometric-analytic methods. Moreover, solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to other PDE will be investigated for general situations, including asymptotically flat as well as cosmological spacetimes, and thereby interesting local and global structures are expected to be found.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quite often, these stellar objects are also permeated by very large magnetic fields. A special class of neutron stars, known as magnetars, can have surface magnetic fields fifteen orders of magnitude stronger than the sun?s, and even much stronger fields in their inner cores are expected to exist. A very important goal of the nuclear theory community is to model and investigate the properties of matter under these extreme conditions. The recent observations of gravitational waves generated by neutron star mergers and the subsequent detection of gamma-ray bursts and other electromagnetic signals from the same source opened a new, very promising era of multimessenger astronomy ? one that is pushing the boundaries of knowledge and understanding about the star?s composition, elements formation, and the evolution of our universe. In this multi-messenger era, observations including pulsar timing, gamma-ray bursts, and gravitational waves detection are booming, so the pressure to identify models of star composition that can explain those observations is intensifying. This project is aligned with these efforts, trying to explore the matter phases that can exist at extreme conditions like high matter density and extremely strong magnetic fields. Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit through their participation in related research tasks.<br/><br/>In 2015, the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observatories opened a new window to observe the universe through gravitational waves (GW). On August 17th, 2017, a new type of astrophysical source of GW was detected that signalized the sources as NS. NS are unique natural laboratories for investigating the physics of cold and highly dense nuclear matter beyond the capability of terrestrial experiments. Macroscopic characteristics of NS, such as masses, radii, tidal deformability, cooling, and other properties that can be measured from GW and electromagnetic observations, are related, through the star equation of state and its heat transport, to the inner matter phase of the star. In this project, the PIs will use the insight gained in previous work regarding the connection between topological condensed matter systems and cold-dense quark matter to explore some transformative ideas like a possible connection between NS and dark matter, as well as to continue expanding the understanding of quark-matter under extreme conditions.<br/><br/>This project advances the objectives of ""Windows on the Universe: the Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics"", one of the 10 Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The unifying theme for the IQIM is the exploration of collective quantum phenomena that endow physical systems of many interacting constituents with astonishing properties that in effect transform the weirdness of the microscopic quantum realm to macroscopic scales. The principal motivations for the creation of the IQIM are the extraordinary set of scientific opportunities associated with the study of exotic quantum states of matter and the potential for discovery brought by newly developed tools from Quantum Information Science.  The IQIM ties together the diverse Caltech community of researchers, from physics to applied physics, to computer science, who focus on emergent quantum phenomena and provides a sustaining base for the scientific development of a new field of research that will actively involve national and international communities of researchers in QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS. By way of extensive programs in education and outreach, the IQIM will impact high school and college education and will engage the general public with the ""mind boggling"" nature of the quantum realm.<br/><br/>It has long been known that individual atoms and electrons, as well as electromagnetic and mechanical oscillators (i.e., photons and phonons), obey laws of quantum physics that in many respects defy common sense. Under the right conditions, interactions among many such quantum objects can lead to remarkable quantum phenomena that have heretofore not existed in nature. Advances to create, characterize, and utilize such exotic quantum phenomena have been made in condensed matter physics (CMP), atomic-molecular-optical physics (AMOP), and at the interface between these areas. In conjunction with parallel developments in quantum information science (QIS), a revolution is underway in the study of exotic quantum systems that is the unifying theme and driving motivation for the IQIM. Progress in the experimental realization and theoretical understanding in this area will surely have profound implications for basic physics. The IQIM will merge insights and analytic tools from QIS with advancing laboratory capabilities in CMP, AMOP, and MQS for the discovery and characterization of exotic quantum states of matter, and will thereby shed light on issues at the core of physics. Eventually, the ability to manipulate exotic quantum systems may lead to new technological capabilities, including methods for designing and exploiting quantum materials.<br/><br/>The Institute for Quantum Information and Matter will have the following scientific thrusts:<br/><br/>Quantum Information: Investigators at the current NSF-sponsored Institute for Quantum Information (IQI) have made Caltech a recognized world leader in theoretical QIS.  IQI faculty are integral members of the IQIM and conduct research that is closely allied to the IQIM, e.g., the application of topological principles to quantum phase transitions and the discovery of universal features of entanglement that that distinguish quantum phases of matter.  Research at the IQIM includes investigations of the connections between quantum information science and other aspects of basic physics.  IQI scientists will lead the quest to apply insights into the properties of quantum entanglement for the study of quantum many-body systems and quantum phase transitions, as well as to apply quantum information theory to illuminate how information is encoded in spacetimes subject to strong quantum fluctuations. The IQI will also continue its world leading programs on quantum computation and communication.<br/><br/>Quantum Many-Body Physics: Caltech has world leading programs in the quantum physics of strongly interacting many-body systems (e.g., superconductors, exotic magnets, strongly correlated electron systems, etc.). Research thrusts in this area will emphasize emergent quantum phenomena, including quantum Hall physics, topological states of matter, exotic magnetic systems, and ultra-cold atomic gases, and with strong connections to powerful theoretical techniques from QIS. These studies will involve some of the most fascinating and puzzling manifestations of many-body quantum mechanics.<br/><br/>Quantum Optics: Another area of great strength at Caltech is the study of optical interactions at the level of one atom and photon, where seminal advances in the realization of new paradigms for light-matter interactions by way of micro- and nano-scopic optical cavities have been made. Within IQIM, existing capabilities for quantum control of strong interactions of single atoms and photons will be extended to explore quantum many-body systems composed of 1- and 2-D arrays of atoms whose interactions are mediated by photons in microscopic quantum optical circuits.<br/><br/>Quantum Mechanics of Mechanical Systems:  Faculty in the IQIM in will build upon recent advances in opto- and electro-mechanics 1) to achieve quantum control of single phonons in simple material systems, thereby enabling lithographic fabrication of quantum many-body systems with phonon mediated interactions, and 2) to create human-sized objects in entangled quantum states within the setting of LIGO.<br/><br/>The IQIM has many facets beyond fundamental research to explore exotic quantum states of matter and the interface with QIS. With the end of scalability of conventional silicon-based information technology on the horizon, it is vitally important to explore aggressively new paradigms for information technology. By attracting and training top students and postdoctoral scholars in QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS, the IQIM will significantly strengthen the US presence in these areas and will broaden the nation's technical base.  A particularly important aspect of the IQIM?s broader impact is a vibrant visitor program, which fuels intellectual excitement, facilitates collaborations and exchanges of scientific ideas, and performs a highly valued service for national and international communities at the interfaces of QIS, CMP, AMOP, and MQS.  <br/><br/>The IQIM will also undertake extensive programs for outreach and the development of human resources.  The goal is to use the public's fascination with the mysteries of the quantum realm to engage a broad community in basic science and education.  Activities include the following:<br/>The Caltech Precollege Science Initiative (CAPSI )- In collaboration with CAPSI, IQIM will develop high school curricula for one to two week instructional modules related to the scientific activities of the Institute, <br/>Summer internships for high school teachers and students from multiethnic LA regional high schools,<br/>Caltech MURF program for undergraduate research experience of minority students in IQIM laboratories,<br/>Disseminating science via a science and entertainment partnership in collaboration with The Science and Entertainment Exchange (SEE),<br/>Development of university curricula related to IQIM fields of research,<br/>Public presentations via the Caltech Watson Lectures and YouTube videos.<br/><br/>These activities will be accessible via an interactive IQIM website.<br/><br/>Funding is provided by the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering."

Understanding the nature of this ""dark matter"" is one of the major unsolved problems in physics.  Primordial black holes (PBH's) are fascinating dark-matter candidates.  PBH's could have formed in the infant Universe, before the first stars even existed.  Professor Ali-Haimoud aims to develop tests of PBH's by predicting their effect on maps of the early Universe and examining the gravitational waves they would emit, and by comparing these predictions with observations. In addition, he will develop a novel way to study the initial conditions of the Universe by quantifying their impact on certain cosmological phase transitions.  As such, this research serves the national interest by promoting the progress of fundamental science in the United States.  This research will also have significant broader impacts.  Professor Ali-Haimoud will include the results of this research in his graduate and undergraduate physics courses and will also directly engage students in these investigations.  In addition, he will develop a course for underserved New York City high-school students on the physics of sailing in which he hopes to foster enthusiasm for physics by drawing parallels between sailing and gravitational waves and black holes. <br/><br/>More specifically, the first and main focus of this research is to establish robust limits on the abundance of PBH's of about one to one thousand solar masses through their impact on cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, and especially their gravitational-wave signals for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).  Professor Ali-Haimoud will extend his analytic calculations of the merger rate of PBH binaries to realistic mass distributions, estimate the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background accounting for high eccentricities, and establish through numerical simulation whether PBH binaries formed in the early Universe are significantly affected by non-linear structures.  He will also extend his work on CMB limits by estimating the self-consistent luminosity of accreting PBH's, and by studying the nature of accretion (spherical vs. disk-like).  The second project involves exploring an entirely new idea:  the impact of small-scale baryon perturbations on the global recombination history.  This effect can probe the currently unconstrained small-scale baryon isocurvature perturbation.  Professor Ali-Haimoud will explore this idea quantitatively by studying perturbed radiative transfer in the Lyman-alpha line during recombination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They provide the best information about the extremely warped space and time around black holes, exotic neutron stars, and, within the next decade, a unique probe of the expansion of the universe over the last several billion years. Gravitational-waves can be thought of as the audio soundtrack to the movie of the cosmos that humanity has been watching for many years with our telescopes. To measure gravitational-waves, scientists have developed the most sensitive vibration measurement technology in history. The work proposed here aims to push beyond the usual measurement limits of quantum physics and molecular vibrations and produce a novel way of making even more sensitive measurements. In addition to the improvement in astrophysical sensitivity, such measurement science breakthroughs can be used to dramatically improve sensors in hand-held devices and consumer products. <br/><br/>Gravitational-wave detectors provide the best information about the extremely warped spacetime around black holes, exotic nuclear matter in neutron stars, and, within the next decade, a unique probe of cosmology at high redshifts. The current LIGO detectors will approach the thermodynamic and quantum mechanical limits of their designs within a few years. This project will develop high precision techniques to extend the astrophysical reach by a factor of 5. To do so, Brownian thermal noise will be suppressed by a novel combination of cryogenics and materials science. Quantum backaction and squeezed light will be exploited to surpass the usual quantum limits of interferometry. Such a dramatic change in the sensitivity should increase the detection rate of binary neutron star mergers to ~10/day and the rate of binary black hole mergers to ~30/day.

Numerical relativity simulations have shown that the pressure-density relationship (known as equation of state) of hot and dense matter plays a fundamental role in simulating the collisions of neutron stars.  Neutron stars are up to twice as massive as our Sun but are typically only around 20 kilometers across. At such extraordinary densities, atomic nuclei collapse, and neutrons and protons are squeezed so tightly together that they may disintegrate into a plasma made of up and down quarks, which are the most fundamental building blocks of matter.  The goal of this project is to determine a comprehensive set of state-of-the art models for the equation of state of superdense nuclear matter for use by researchers working on neutron-star merger simulations. In particular, the group will investigate the role of quarks for neutron-star mergers and identify possible signals by means of which quarks may register themselves in the gravitational-wave signals produced by merging neutron stars. The models for the equation of state will be made available to the community at online services (CompOSE, StellarCollapse).

The 3PNJL model is an effective model of quantum chromodynamics which allows for a contemporary modeling of quark matter. It provides a functional and numerically tractable approach to quantum chromodynamics. The model accounts for the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and mimics quark confinement via the Polyakov-loop potential. Quark deconfinement at zero and finite temperature will be studied using both the Gibbs and Maxwell condition for phase equilibrium.

But the microscopic world of atoms and their constituent particles is more accurately described by quantum mechanics. These two regimes of physics - classical and quantum - are well understood, but what happens at the boundary between the two regimes? Is there even a clear, well-defined boundary? When does an object transition from classical to quantum behavior? And why should we care? Scientists have come to understand that quantum behavior is present in objects of all sizes, shapes and compositions, but is usually masked by thermal noise - the constant jittering of atoms that make up the objects due to heat energy stored and released. Removing thermal noise to reveal quantum mechanical behavior is very difficult even for a small collection of atoms, and certainly very hard for much larger objects. But it can be done, initially just for a few special atoms, and recently for increasingly larger objects. Macroscopic objects that exhibit quantum behavior are useful not only for studying the classical-quantum boundary, but also have some very practical applications. Among these applications is generating exotic quantum states of light, called ""squeezed"" states, that can be used to make more precise measurements than ordinary light. Interferometric gravitational wave detectors, such as the Advance LIGO ones that discovered gravitational waves from colliding black holes, rely on measuring the positions of mirrors with sub-attometer (less than one billionth of a billionth of a meter) precision. To further improve their sensitivity, one can inject squeezed states of light into these instruments. This work pertains to making these special states of light by strongly coupling laser light to movable mirrors whose motion is dominated by quantum mechanical effects rather than thermal noise. <br/><br/>To make a squeezed state, it is necessary to find a way to correlate two usually uncorrelated properties of the light - a combination of the amplitude and phase. This is usually done by passing light through a nonlinear optical material whose refractive index depends on the strength of the electric field (amplitude of the light), such that amplitude fluctuations get imprinted on the phase of the light as it passes through that material. In this work the PI uses an alternative, and relatively unexplored, method of using optomechanical coupling. An intense light beam is incident on a movable mirror. The amplitude fluctuations of the light drive the mirror position due to radiation pressure. The mirror position fluctuations are imprinted on the phase of the light reflected from the mirror, thus correlating amplitude and phase fluctuations. The setup comprises an optical cavity where one mirror is a nano-fabricated cantilevered oscillator made of a GaAlAs heterostructure Bragg reflector.  The other mirror is ablated and coated on to an optical fiber tip. The aim is to generate squeezed light in a broad audio frequency band using this apparatus. To do so, it is necessary to reduce the thermal noise of the mirror oscillator enough for its motion to be dominated by quantum fluctuations, which requires a highly optimized oscillator design that may also be cryogenic cooled. As with any quantum-limited experiment, a variety of other classical noises, such as seismic and acoustic vibrations, classical intensity and phase noise of the optical system must be reduced and controlled."

These supernovae occur when the iron core of a massive star collapses to a neutron star. Releasing its gravitational binding energy in a violent explosion as neutrinos, the resulting neutron star, for a few seconds, outshines the rest of the observable universe.  Viewed as a nuclear physics laboratory, core-collapse supernovae produce the highest densities of matter and energy in the modern universe.  However, the precise mechanism of this explosion has not been unambiguously pinned down and this fifty-year old conundrum is one of the central remaining unsolved problems in theoretical astrophysics.  Supernova theory is an amalgam of much of physics, and represents one of the most complex computational problems of modern science. Supercomputers, such as Blue Waters, are essential to make progress in simulating and understanding the evolution of the supernova event and neutron star birth.  A solution to the core-collapse supernova problem would benefit ongoing efforts of observers and instrument designers in the U.S. and around the world engaged in projects to determine the origin of the elements, measure gravitational waves (LIGO), and other important physics experiments.<br/><br/>The project will conduct three-dimensional radiation/hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the goal of constraining, and ultimately determining, the mechanism of explosion.  During this explosion process, a combination of high-density nuclear physics, multi-dimensional hydrodynamics, radiation transport, and neutrino physics determines whether and how the star explodes.   The project will use the newly developed and tested code FORNAX incorporating state-of-the-art microphysics and methodologies, with excellent scalability to beyond 100,000 cores per tasks.   Various observational diagnostics, such as neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures and residual neutron star masses and kicks, will be derived for all models calculated.  Supernova explosions and their products are central to the origin of the elements, the birth of pulsars and black holes, and the dynamics of galaxies and the interstellar medium, and a fundamental theoretical understanding of such explosions will inform the interpretation of data derived from, among other platforms, NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, Swift, NuStar, and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since they were discovered in 1967, about two thousand neutron stars have been found (including several discovered in 2010 and 2011 by Einstein@Home).  Neutron star observations provide a unique view into the behavior of matter at extreme pressures and densities, and into the nature of gravitation when gravity is very strong.  Under certain circumstances, neutron stars can be emitters of pulsing radio waves (pulsars). Einstein@home exploits the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope in the world, to search for these signals. It is possible that neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 but have never been directly detected. Einstein@home can search the data from gravitational wave detectors such as those of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for these signals. Einstein@home also supports the BOINC software infrastructure to benefit dozens of computationally intensive projects in other areas of science, that also exploit volunteer distributed computing. And it is a remarkable tool for scientific outreach: Einstein@Home allows hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens from around the world to participate in and make meaningful contribution to cutting-edge scientific research."

Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window into fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator.  Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory.  In addition to the bursts of gravitational waves that have recently been discovered by the LIGO and VIRGO observatories, there is likely to be a ""background"" of gravitational waves that is always present.  Loops of cosmic strings are one of the sources that may contribute to this background, and observation of the background is an important way in which cosmic strings might be discovered.  Professor Olum will study how the shape and motion of cosmic string loops changes during their lives and how this affects their emission of gravitational waves that become part of this background.  If and when the gravitational wave background is discovered, this research will help us to distinguish whether it comes from cosmic strings or some other source, and to determine the properties of the cosmic string network if it is the source of the background.  As such, research in this direction advances the national interest by further the development of basic sciences in the United States.  Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in his work and thereby train future generations of research physicists.  This work will also connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.<br/><br/>More technically, Professor Olum will analyze gravitational back-reaction on cosmic string loops, to see how features such as cusps and kinks are modified by back-reaction.  He will simulate realistic populations of cosmic string loops to see how their shapes evolve under back-reaction and compute the resulting gravitational emission spectrum for comparison with observations.  He will also study the velocities acquired by loops in reaction to anisotropic gravitational wave emission, the so-called ""rocket effect"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum mechanics was invented to study the behavior of physical systems at the atomic scale. In the past century, understanding the quantum foundations of nature has led to fundamental understanding of the subatomic world, as well as a rich landscape of quantum-enabled technologies, from lasers to magnetic resonance imaging to nanomedicine. The proposed work builds on advances in nanotechnology and precision measurement to push the frontier of both understanding the fundamental nature of the universes, as well as development of quantum sensing technologies for precision measurement. By using the radiation pressure force from intense laser beams to push on mirrors, the exquisite quantum properties of the light can be imprinted onto the mechanical motion of the mirrors. The light itself, in turn, is used to read out the position of the mirror. This light-mirror coupling can be used to generate interesting and practically useful quantum states, provided the thermally driven motion of the mirror is small enough.<br/><br/>The proposed work couples laser light to a novel custom-designed macroscopic mirror that has low thermal noise.  One goal of the proposed work is to optically trap and cool a macroscopic mirror. This would allow scientists to ask the intriguing question: is there a size scale on which quantum mechanics no longer works? Even though quantum mechanics usually applies to the microscopic world, why would nature have a special size scale? A second, more practical, goal is to use the light-mirror interactions to create an exotic quantum state of light called a ""squeezed state.? Squeezed states of light are used to increase the precision of optical measurements, such as the laser interferometry used by LIGO to detect gravitational waves. Squeezed states generated using light-mirror coupling could be well-suited for improving the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors. A notable feature of the proposed work is that it is carried out at room temperature, without the substantial infrastructure and cost of cryogenic cooling, making these devices better suited for enhancing the sensitivity of quantum sensors in a wide range of applications from gravitational-wave detection to quantum information technologies. This work is inherently cross-disciplinary, combining the techniques and formalism of quantum optics, optomechanics, and quantum measurement science with gravitational-wave detection. It therefore advances multiple fields, training personnel with a broad range of skills that prepares them to be part of a technical workforce with quantum expertise, which is increasingly sought after in academia, the government and the private sector.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite a wealth of observations across the electromagnetic spectrum over the last four decades, much of what happens in the deep interior of NS remains inscrutable. Knowledge of neutron star physics is growing rapidly, due to X-ray telescopes in space, laboratory nuclear experiments, and gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).  A research group at Michigan State University will help astronomers to better understand neutron stars by modeling the thermally unstable ignition of carbon on the NS surface and the resulting explosion (a ""superburst"") using a state-of-the-art multidimensional hydrodynamics computer code.  The models can reveal conditions in the outer layer of neutron stars, and help answer some critical science questions identified in National Academy reports: what is the nature of matter at exceedingly high density and temperature?, and what controls the mass, radius, and spin of compact stellar remnants?  The planned work includes activities to recruit the next generation of scientists and to inform the public, who ultimately support the scientific endeavor.  The group will develop educational resources to make it easier to use open-source computer simulations to explore stellar physics and incorporate discoveries made during the award into public talks at Michigan State's Abrams Planetarium.<br/><br/>Neutron stars are unique natural laboratories to study quantum chromodynamics at finite density and low temperature.  A number of recent observational, theoretical, and experimental developments have raised new questions about the internal constitution of neutron stars. For low-mass X-ray binaries, in which the neutron star accretes hydrogen- or helium-rich material, X-ray observations of accretion-induced phenomena over timescales ranging from seconds to decades provide important information about different layers of the neutron star. During accretion, runaway thermonuclear burning of the accreted material is observable as a Type I X-ray burst. The thousands of X-ray bursts and the rarer and more energetic superbursts encode information about the physics of dense matter and the workings of the accretion disk and boundary layer.   The researchers will use ignition models that account for relevant heating and cooling processes in the neutron star crust. The simulations will yield testable predictions for both the precursor burst observed from some sources and the evolution of luminosity with time during the superburst. The models will inform astronomers about conditions in the outer layer of neutron stars, and may give information about the explosion's effect on the accretion flow and the nature of nuclear flames in dense matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key equation of General Relativity is due to Einstein, and black holes are its most surprising solutions. Black holes occupy a central stage in our understanding of gravity and tremendous progress in their research has been accomplished in the past decades. They are expected to form as a result of gravitational collapse and are surrounded by matter with which they interact. They are expected to radiate energy away in the form of gravitational waves (as detected by LIGO) and settle to a stationary state. Most mathematical models used in the study of such evolution of black holes do not consider any matter or energy field present in the spacetime: more precisely, they only assume the presence of the gravitational field. This is called the case of the vacuum Einstein equation. Even though the vacuum Einstein equation already presents many difficulties from the mathematical point of view, they hardly represent a complete picture about the physics involved. In order to obtain a realistic model for astrophysical black holes, matter fields should be added to the Einstein equation to model the surrounding of the black holes. This research is aimed at the study of black hole stability both for the vacuum Einstein equation and for the coupled equations with electromagnetic radiation.<br/> <br/> <br/>The plan of this research is to create a rigorous and systematic approach to understand the interaction of gravitational radiation with other matter fields present in astrophysical objects. We plan to consider the interaction between gravitation and electromagnetic fields, governed by the Maxwell equations, and develop a rigorous and clear understanding of their interactions. Our approach is based on the Teukolsky formalism. The Einstein-Maxwell equation has many features in common with the vacuum Einstein equation, but also presents new substantial difficulties related to the coupling of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions.  One of the difficulties is to identify gauge-invariant quantities which transport electromagnetic and gravitational radiation and derive the partial differential equations they satisfy. We then plan to be able to generalize the main ideas in dealing with those interactions to other matter systems, like Einstein-Vlasov, null dust or complex scalar, which are of fundamental importance in astrophysical systems. In general, in the case of the Einstein equation coupled with matter fields, we expect to obtain coupled hyperbolic PDEs with sources which interact one with another.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientific research projects are forced to invest time and effort into developing and supporting Identity and Access Management (IdAM) services, distracting them from the core goals of their research collaboration. The ""CILogon 2.0"" project provides an IdAM platform that enables scientists to work together to meet their IdAM needs more effectively so they can allocate more time and effort to their core mission of scientific research. To ensure that the project makes a real contribution to scientific collaborations, the researchers have partnered with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) Physics Frontiers Center, and the Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE).

Federated identity management enables researchers to use their home organization identities to access cyberinfrastructure, rather than requiring yet another username and password to log on. Collaborative organization management enables research projects to define user groups for authorization to collaboration platforms (e.g., wikis, mailing lists, and domain applications). The ""CILogon 2.0"" project integrates and expands on the existing CILogon and COmanage software to provide an integrated Identity and Access Management (IdAM) platform for cyberinfrastructure.

General relativity is a geometric theory of gravity; in this theory the effects of gravity are due to the curvature of the universe. The gravitational field and other fields, black holes and related objects, may be described and analyzed using geometric methods.  In very general terms, this project is concerned with the study of certain features of gravity of current scientific interest from this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of Riemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and Lorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These theories provide a method for studying the relationship among three fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature (i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the global shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal structure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and light cones).<br/> <br/>An initial data set in a spacetime consists of a smooth spacelike hypersurface, its induced metric and second fundamental form.  The principal investigator (PI) will continue his investigations concerning asyptotically flat initial data sets with horizons.  Such initial data sets model isolated gravitating systems with black holes.  In this context the PI, with various collaborators, has established results on 'topological censorship' at the initial data level, for initial data sets in three and higher dimensions.  These results establish, under natural physical assumptions, restrictions on the geometry and topology of the spatial domain of outer communication in black hole spacetimes. They rest in large measure on the rather recently developed theory of marginally outer trapped surfaces (MOTSs).  These are objects of considerable interest.   On the one hand they play an important role in the theory of black holes, and on the other, they may be viewed as natural spacetime analogues of minimal surfaces in Riemannian geometry.  Although MOTS are not in general variational objects, they nevertheless turn out to have properties remarkably similar to minimal surfaces.   The work of the PI, and related results, lead to many interesting open problems that the PI will investigate, including problems concerning the topology of MOTSs and the spatial domain of outer communication, as well as problems concerning MOTS existence and rigidity phenomena, both in the compact and noncompact case.  Topological issues will benefit from a deeper understanding of the relationship between MOTSs and so-called immersed MOTSs.  The PI will also work on some problems pertaining to `time-symmetric'  (i.e., totally geodesic) initial data sets.  The PI will implement a strategy for proving a positive mass theorem for asymptotically hyperbolic (AH) manifolds, in the spirit of the Schoen-Yau positive mass proof in the asymptotically Euclidean case. The research has the potential to close a gap in previous positive mass proofs in the AH case.  A further aim in this direction would then be to try to use this method to obtain a proof of the Horowitz-Myers conjecture concerning the AdS soliton.  The PI will also continue on-going projects involving photon spheres and spacetime rigidity problems."

The Einstein equations, which are the field equations of general relativity, describe how spacetime universe curves in the presence of matter; it is this curvature that is responsible for the effects of gravity. General relativity is a remarkably accurate theory, which describes the formation of black holes, predicts the existence of gravitational waves (now famously detected by LIGO), and governs the large-scale behavior of the entire cosmos.  The aim of this conference is to gather together leading experts at the intersection of mathematical general relativity and geometric analysis to discuss recent advances and new directions of research in this area, and to expose graduate students and young mathematicians to these developments.  <br/><br/><br/>Mathematical general relativity is a very rapidly developing area of research.  Geometric analysis has played a remarkable role in this development, beginning with the singularity theorems of Hawking and Penrose.  Many advances have ensued in both the elliptic and hyperbolic aspects of the theory, including developments in the theory of black holes, in understanding of Penrose's cosmic censorship conjecture, and in the study of manifolds of nonnegative scalar curvature.  Geometric inequalities, such as the positive mass theorem and the Riemannian Penrose inequality, play a deep and fundamental role in general relativity.  In recent years new geometric inequalities, involving physical quantities such as mass, angular momentum, charge, etc., have given rise to many interesting open questions.  Studies of initial data sets for gravitational fields have proven to be fruitful areas of research.  The initial data for the Cauchy problem associated to the Einstein field equations are required to satisfy the so-called constraint equations, a system of nonlinear partial differential equations, the geometric origin of which are the Gauss-Codazzi equations.  Great progress has been made in developing techniques for solving the constraint equations, both by the conformal method and by gluing methods.  The development of the theory of marginally outer trapped surfaces, which are general initial data versions of minimal surfaces, has led to results concerning the topology of black holes (and the region exterior to black holes), and has made possible a direct proof of the spacetime positive mass theorem in dimensions less than eight. The recent proof of the (Riemannian) positive mass theorem (in all dimensions and without spin assumption) has greatly advanced knowledge about geometric singularities and their roles in initial data sets.  Efforts to obtain a localized measure of mass, which includes a contribution from the gravitational field, have led to various notions of quasi-local mass, and continues to be a very active area of research. Geometric flows have played a fundamental role in many of these developments. The conference will address all these topics.

A wealth of information comes from observing them in the final moments of their lives, when they are members of a binary system that merge due to the emission of gravitational waves (GWs). If a NS is member of the binary, then this merger may also produce light, or electromagnetic emission (EM), which greatly increases the astrophysical information that can be extracted.  This was shown in the many observations of the merger event GW170817/GRB170817A, the results of which impacted knowledge in a variety of research areas, from high-energy astrophysics, to nuclear physics, to cosmology.   A research group at the State University of New York at Stony Brook will undertake theoretical work aimed at maximizing the research gain from future observations.  The variety of topics (and techniques) that this research plan encompasses makes it ideal for the involvement of students at all levels, including undergraduates. The principal investigator (PI) is especially interested in involving female undergraduate student in this research, with the goal of empowering and giving confidence to young women in their abilities to do science, and hence encouraging them to pursue careers as scientists.<br/><br/>This project will explore several facets of binary formation and evolution, and of the GW-EM connection, while probing issues of fundamental physics. In particular: (a) It will develop a general framework for the interpretation of the radiation from NS-NS and NS-BH sources triggered by the LIGO and Virgo GW detectors. The goal is to connect the properties of binary compact merger ejecta with the EM emission of their jet-cocoon systems, the time delay from the GW signal, and the type of compact object remnant left behind.  Along with mass measurements from GWs, this information aids in constraining the equation of state of NS matter.  (b) It will extend and refine the predictions of dynamical formation of compact object binaries in star clusters. Among the outcomes will be an exploration of the mass distribution of NS-BH binaries produced via this channel, and a comparison to those formed from field binaries. (c) It will couple results from the first two studies to compute the broadband EM radiation expected for the main formation channels of NS-NS and NS-BH binaries, as well as BH-BH in dense environments, extracting potentially discriminating features and aiding searches for EM counterparts to GW triggers. As part of this project, the PI plans to partner with the WISE (Women In Science and Engineering) program at Stony Brook. This will involve (a) supervision of undergraduate research projects during the academic year; (b) giving guest lectures in a course specifically designed by WISE to discuss opportunities in STEM fields; (c) being a high-school mentor in the WISE after school program.

How these binary black holes (BBHs) form is an important question in astrophysics. One promising scenario is that they form through dynamical interactions of stars in dense stellar clusters (DSCs), in which stars are closer together than in other parts of a galaxy and can frequently interact through their mutual gravity. A research team at Carnegie Mellon University will create the first self-consistent, star-by-star models of dense star clusters with realistic initial conditions taken from cosmological simulations, or simulations of how large groups of stars form from giant clouds of gas. The scientists will then use these models to create a population of the BBH mergers arising in star clusters and also from binaries formed in isolation, using identical initial conditions and stellar physics. The team will then make detailed predictions for future observations from GW detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo, and establish the connection between our understanding of cosmology and galaxy assembly and the new field of gravitational-wave astronomy. This project will also be used to introduce GW astronomy to a larger community. During the course of the research, the lead scientists will work with at least two undergraduate students, who will be supported by summer programs at Carnegie Mellon. The principal investigator (PI) will also continue to visit conferences dedicated to under-represented students in STEM, both to present the work and recruit students. <br/><br/>The researchers will examine several galaxy models created as part of the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, which has recently developed sufficient resolution to resolve the formation and collapse of giant molecular clouds, the progenitors of DSCs. These initial conditions will be integrated forward to the present day using direct N-body and Monte Carlo methods for modeling star clusters, which include all the necessary physics (stellar evolution, gravitational waves, etc.) to predict the present-day appearance of these DSCs and the binary black hole (BBH) mergers that they produce during their evolution. The PI has demonstrated before that there are unique features of BBHs formed in DSCs which will allow them to be distinguished from other formation channels. These features, such as the masses and the orbital eccentricities, depend sensitively on the initial masses, metallicities, and core concentrations of the DSCs. By using the same stellar physics and realistic cosmological initial conditions, this work will show how different galaxy properties, such as the galaxy type and star-formation history influence the gravitational-wave landscape of the local universe. The group plans to make their data public and easily accessible, which will have broad utility in many fields.

Surprisingly, quantum vortices can be studied on earth with ultracold-atom experiments, operating almost a billion times colder than outer space. These experiments can be adjusted to mimic many aspects of neutron stars, and this project will enable them to be used as analog quantum computers to simulate turbulence in nuclear astrophysics. By transcending current limitations of classical computers, this will rapidly accelerate the progress of science, targeting the 40-year old mystery of pulsar glitches. This program combines two of the NSF's Big Ideas, advancing quantum simulations (Quantum Leap) to maximize the return on detector investment (Windows on the Universe). Pulsar glitches might even be heard with the next round of gravitational wave observations at the NSF LIGO facility, informing nuclear physics by providing insight into their microscopic nature. In addition to advancing basic science, this project will explore quantum dynamics with potential applications to quantum devices, and develop accessible programming models to help students and researchers more effectively utilize national investment in high-performance computing (HPC) to advance the pace of scientific discovery. Finally, a superfluid explorer application will be developed to help the public and students appreciate quantum behavior, and better understand the science at the core of the next quantum revolution.<br/><br/>This project will deliver computationally efficient models that accurately describe dynamic quantum effects, including negative-mass hydrodynamics from dispersion relationships engineered with spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. Ultracold atom experiments explore a rich set of phenomena that will be used validate our theoretical techniques, then these techniques will be used to drive the discovery of new phenomena. Extensions of this theory to nuclear physics will ultimately be used to model superfluid vortex dynamics in neutron stars with the goal of understanding pulsar glitches - sudden increases in the spinning of neutron stars even though they continually lose angular momentum. This project will advance a broad range of fields, including atomic physics, condensed matter, non-linear optics, nuclear theory, and nuclear astrophysics. The research will result in publicly available codes for solving problems in quantum dynamics, presented in intuitive and interactive notebooks with video tutorials demonstrating how to use high-level programming languages to drive high-performance computers. These tools will significantly improve the infrastructure for research and education, educating researchers to effectively utilize medium to large scale computing resources for the advancement of science. Through this project, both undergraduate and graduate students will be trained with the analytical and high-performance computational skills to succeed in their future pursuits in academia, at national laboratories, and in industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions have been proposed as theoretically favored candidates for dark matter. Despite the strong evidence for the existence of dark matter, neither WIMPs nor axions have been conclusively detected. Dark matter axions may be detected through their conversion into a narrow band Radio Frequency (RF) signal in a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. Under NSF funding, a Yale-UC Berkeley-University of Colorado Boulder collaboration came together in 2011 to design, build and operate an advanced technology experiment, HAYSTAC, to serve both as an innovation test-bed to develop new cavity designs and quantum-limited photon detection schemes, and as a pathfinder to take first data in the 10 to 50 micro-eV mass range, well above all previous such searches. This award will provide funding to continue this axion search. The collaboration-wide efforts of HAYSTAC are leading to many technical innovations. R&D on superconducting thin-films and sub-quantum-limited photon detection will produce unanticipated spin-offs. The experimental techniques being developed, in particular magnetic shielding and data analysis, will be useful to other experiments that use similar quantum sensing techniques. The group will continue their successful recruiting and training of new talent inclusively. HAYSTAC has been very successful in attracting many bright young people to the field. The PIs are active in giving popular public lectures and participating in educational outreach. Wright Laboratory has begun negotiations with the Peabody Natural History Museum at Yale to prepare an exhibit highlighting the history and research of the Laboratory itself, featuring dark matter studies.<br/><br/>HAYSTAC is the first dark matter search to successfully incorporate a squeezed-vacuum-state quantum limited receiver, and along with LIGO, is among the first fundamental physics experiments to use squeezed-state receivers for data production. The actual system noise temperature is twice the standard quantum limit (SQL), with the additional quantum of noise from transmission losses. During Phase I, HAYSTAC established an exclusion limit of 2.3 times the KSVZ coupling at 23.15 to 24.0 micro-eV.  HAYSTAC is nearing its goal of increasing the mass scan rate by at least a factor of 2 compared to Phase I, with sensitivity at the level of about twice the KSVZ axion coupling. Additional innovative improvements are planned, including a new symmetrized-tuner design cavity and an improved squeezed state receiver that eliminates losses from circulators and other elements in the present receiver design. A long run will then commence to cover the axion mass range predicted by Klaer and Moore, based on the first and only calculation of axion production incorporating in a self-consistent way both the vacuum realignment and string radiation mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The IPTA collaboration will detect GW from vastly larger and heavier black holes at the cores of merging galaxies, via the precise timing of cosmic clocks called radio pulsars. The astronomers anticipate that low-frequency GW will be detected within the next five years, ushering in a revolution in our understanding of the growth and structure of our Universe. U.S. undergraduate and graduate students will be fully involved in all aspects of the project. They will collaborate with prominent scientists in different countries, play a critical role in one of the potentially transformative scientific discoveries of the century, and develop global competencies to succeed in today's interconnected world.<br/> <br/>The project will monitor a number of radio pulsars using a network of large radio telescopes distributed across the globe, and search for small perturbations in the arrival times of pulsar pulses due to low-frequency gravitational waves.

In order to further increase the sensitivity of the IPTA so that it can detect and, ultimately, characterize the GW universe, the collaboration will be expanded to include researchers and telescopes in China, India, and South Africa. This expansion offers the opportunity for U.S. students to gain experience in the development of pulsar timing programs in these varied countries. The IRES award will fund two undergraduate students and one graduate student to travel to all three countries for 10-week international research experiences.

Finally, he intends to study geodesic completeness properties of hypersurfaces in Minkowski space of constant Gauss-Kronecker curvature. <br/><br/>Professor Schoen's project will lead to a better understanding of solutions of the Einstein equations of General Relativity.

These observations have started to revolutionize our understanding of many areas in physics, including the origins of the heavy elements, like silver, gold, and platinum. However, they also pose many pressing open questions.  This project will make use of the Blue Waters supercomputer to address these open questions.  State-of-the-art NS merger simulations will be performed on the Blue Waters supercomputer to examine all the different possible NS collision scenarios to understand the fundamental physical processes that generated the observation data. This will be followed by extremely high-resolution simulations considering the post-merger evolution.  Simulation results will be made publicly available, and dissemination via movies, public lectures and school visits are planned.<br/><br/>A systematic study of the evolution of NS binary systems compatible with the observed NS collision, GW170817, will be performed by means of merger simulations on Blue Waters, employing sophisticated microphysics and neutrino treatment.  These simulations will ascertain the viability of tidal torques and shocks as mechanisms for the ejection of matter during mergers, which in turn powers the observed optical and infrared transients and synthesizes heavy elements. The impact of the NS equation of state (EOS) will be evaluated by considering a set of 3 EOSs spanning the range of the current nuclear uncertainties. The range of possible outcomes of the merger as a function of the binary parameters and EOSs will be assessed. High-resolution general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the merger remnant will be performed, with sufficient resolution to determine the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and the angular-momentum redistribution in the remnant while employing a microphysical treatment of the NS matter. These simulation results will ascertain the role of magnetohydrodynamics processes in determining the lifetime of the remnant and the observational signatures of an early or delayed black-hole formation. The role played by magnetized winds in the powering of the optical and infrared emissions and their nucleosynthetic yields will be assessed.   In addition, this project will develop significant improvements to current open-source codes, and all improvements will be released to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Obtaining performance in the presence of accelerators requires close attention to the memory hierarchy and chip-level parallelism to reach even a modest fraction of the potential performance. As a result, coding tasks which were once the province of lone graduate students in a single discipline now require interdisciplinary teams of people. Project Chemora will explore the design of a new application framework for automatically creating highly optimized code for high-end computational machines. The system will use as input a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe a problem, it will then construct a machine-specific abstract performance model, and using these it will generate well-tuned code and execution configurations for accelerated (e.g., hybrid CPU/GPU) computing clusters at various scales.  Chemora will improve programmability  by decoupling the science and computer science at a high level, thereby reducing the complexity and number of issues scientists need to collectively understand and allowing individual scientists in the team to focus on their area of specialty. Chemora will improve performance (both wallclock time and energy) for systems with both simple and complex sets of equations by making use of detailed information describing the problem and machine, and will provide improved load balancing through the AMPI framework.<br/><br/>The Chemora project  has chosen the Einstein equations as the primary science driver because these equations are one of the more complex PDE systems, one with many hundreds of terms, and a problem scale that is challenging to optimize for most compilers. Achieving this vision for a general scientific problem would indeed be a ""Grand Challenge"" in computational science, but in order to give the research a sharper focus the project will focus on the simulation of Intermediate mass ratio Binary Black Hole (IBBH) systems. Such systems, consisting of a black hole of mass 100 to 1,000 solar masses orbited by a smaller black hole of mass 5 to 20 solar masses are expected to be important sources of gravitational waves for advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). Accurate modeling of the waveforms from IBBH systems will be necessary in order to extract gravitational wave signals using template-matching data analysis techniques."

Certain aspects of these astrophysical phenomena are detectable in other forms such as gamma-rays, making our scientific endeavor even more promising. However, in order to decipher the detailed inner workings and understand the complete astrophysical process involved in these cataclysmic comic events, their observation through gravitational waves is essential. This award will support active engagement in the quest for the first detection of gravitational waves coincident with gamma-ray burst and neutrino events. The data collected by the global network of gravitational wave detectors, including the Laser Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), will also allow the advance of fundamental science prior to regular detections of cosmic events through gravitational waves by setting astrophysically interesting upper limits to the gravitational waves produced. To increase the repertoire of promising progenitor candidates, the PI and his students will also investigate data analysis techniques related to gravitational waves emitted by eccentric encounters of black hole binary systems.<br/><br/>This award will allow the PI to develop an innovative course at Columbia University specifically designed to enhance the critical foundations of students in experimental science. The curriculum is inspired by gravitational wave research and emphasizes real life experience for students in the laboratory.

In a fraction of a second on September 14, 2015, the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics was born with the detection by the LIGO instruments of two black holes colliding over a billion lightyears away. Less than two years later, over the span of 12 hours on August 17, 2017, the field of gravitational- wave multi-messenger astronomy was born with the detection of both gravitational-waves and light from the collision of two neutron stars. Over the next years many additional collisions will be detected, and this project will explore what these sources will teach us about physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. The project focuses on learning about how the distribution of the masses of the detected systems help us understand how the Universe makes black holes and neutron stars. This relates to how the Universe makes stars, which in turn relates to how the universe makes the elements which are crucial to life. In addition to exploring these fascinating questions and publishing results to help move the field forward, the group will also perform extensive education and outreach activities related to gravitational-waves and black holes.<br/><br/>The project will analyze the source catalogs and determine underlying population distributions. The PI will examine the mass distribution of the component compact objects in the detected binaries. In particular, the PI will explore both the putative lower mass gap (between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole), as well as the upper mass gap (a dearth of black holes of mass 50 solar masses ). Similarly, the PI will explore the spin and mass ratio distributions of the population, as well as the redshift evolution of all of these distributions. Characterizing these distributions, and their evolution, will teach us about the formation and evolution of black holes and neutron stars, as well as binaries that contain them. As our understanding of the distributions improves, the ability to characterize outliers from these underlying distributions also improves. The PI will further study this process, both highlighting the nature of outliers, as well as developing population-based parameter estimation. Furthermore, the PI will study associated astrophysical constraints based on these distributions, including forward modeling of these detections using population synthesis, and machine learning approaches to the equation of state of neutron stars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An ever expanding number of science communities worldwide rely on Condor software tools to harness the power of shared computing resources. Closer to home, over 100 US universities have installed these tools on their campus, and downloads of the <br/>software surpass 2,000 per month. From fulfilling a strategic role of managing high-energy physics computing resources at Brookhaven and Fermi National Labs to enabling research computing at smaller under-represented institutions, Condor technology represents the culmination of 20 years of distributed computing research. The efforts outlined in this proposal allow the research contributions of this software to continue, and strengthen the momentum to enable academia and industry to leverage the power of effective distributed computing. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the proposed effort lies within the novelty of the distributed mechanisms implemented and the software engineering challenges the team faces in developing, maintaining and supporting nearly one million lines of code in an academic setting. As a leading provider of open-source distributed computing capabilities, the software plays an important role as a primary ?building block? in many campus grids as well as community, national and international cyber-infrastructure initiatives. The size, complexity, diversity and quality assurance requirements of the software also lead to challenges in the area of software engineering and integration. Daily builds and testing, version control, software tracking and distributed troubleshooting of multi-layer software stacks are examples of the ongoing challenges.  <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this effort are interdisciplinary and span both academia and industry. Researchers who use Condor tools are able to greatly increase their computing throughput, and consequently increase the size and complexity of the problems they study. The software is widely used in many compute-intensive disciplines, including Art, Biotechnology, Economics, Chemistry, Medical, High Energy and Nuclear Physics, and Computer Science, and has been adopted by both universities and government labs. Furthermore, the software plays a critical role by managing the majority of the compute resources for the US Large Hadron Collider experiments, as well as serving 250 LIGO scientists studying gravitational waves. Condor technology fuels new commercial offerings, such as Red Hat's MRG and Cycle Computing's CycleServer in the past year. These technologies are also used for mission-critical tasks in industry; e.g., Micron Technology uses Condor on 15,000 CPUs worldwide to validate memory chip manufacturing, J.P. Morgan uses Condor on 5,000 CPUs for real-time financial portfolio analysis, and Disney's fully animated film ""The Wild"" used Condor to render more than 70 million frames. Because the high throughput computing capabilities we offer effectively harness even desktop machines running <br/>Windows, it enables students and scientists at underrepresented institutions to pursue research and instruction requiring considerable computing in the absence of access to traditional high-end computing facilities. This proposal directly funds five students, and through GLOW it will provide an excellent training <br/>environment to new generations of interdisciplinary professionals."

The quantum states or waves are described as solutions of partial differential equations and their properties are often determined by the properties of underlying classical (particle) systems. The subject has its origins in geometric optics (going back to the 17th century) and quantum mechanics (going back to the first half of the 20th century) but the numerical, experimental and mathematical advances provide a new range of challenges and research opportunities. For instance, quantum resonances, which in chemistry can describe transitional states in chemical reactions, are now more accessible experimentally, and mathematically, compared to the time when they were introduced. Quasinormal modes, which are an analogue of these resonances in general relativity now have a chance of being observed for the first time, thanks to the LIGO experiments. At the same time, the methods originally developed to study differential equations using insights from classical dynamics, are now successfully used to answer questions about chaotic systems or geometry of geodesics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>Among the specific problems studied by the PI are: (1) distribution of scattering resonances for classically chaotic systems; (2) understand dynamical zeta function (generating function for periods of closed orbits in much the same way as the Riemann zeta function is a generating function of prime numbers); and (3) spectral problems arising in fluid mechanics, specifically in the formation of internal waves. The concrete problem about chaotic scattering concerns the existence of a spectral gap for any (hyperbolic) configuration of convex obstacles in the plane. Since the late 80s it was proposed in the mathematics and physics literature that the gap is determined by the ""topological pressure"" of the trapped reflected rays. Recent advances on the fractal uncertainty principle should imply that there always is a spectral gap. For dynamical zeta functions, one of the goals is to understand the Fried conjecture which proposes a relation between dynamical (value of the zeta function at 0), spectral and topological quantities (corresponding torsions) for general manifolds with chaotic flows. The microlocal tools developed, among others by the PI, are particularly promising here. Internal waves in fluids, theoretically described by spectral methods, have only been observed, in a controlled experiment, 25 years ago. The importance of viscosity and nonlinear effects (on both classical and wave level) is still to be fully understood. The PI and his collaborators made some advances here but many questions, such as the analysis of the physically relevant boundary value problems, remain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this end the PI and coPI originally planned to implement a set of activities intended to promote physics awareness and excitement in K-12 students and the general public.  The original proposal listed seven activities: 1) a poster contest for fifth graders; 2) a physics quest for middle school students with the location of a hidden treasure to be determined by a set of experiments; 3) measurement of the radius of the earth by the method of Eratosthenes for high school students; 4) ""Physics on the Road"" for all ages in which physics demonstrations and hands-on experiments are taken from a university-based department to schools and other appropriate locations; 5) ""Stories in  Physics"" which will be a set of interviews with prominent physicists made available as CDs for radio stations and as audio on the World Year of Physics 2005 Website; 6) ""Einstein at Home,"" a distributed computing project similar to ""SETI at Home"" in which data from the LIGO detectors is made available to home PCs to be analyzed during idle CPU time; and 7) ""Einstein in Four Dimensions,"" a poster to be produced by the APS to graphically highlight the contributions of Einstein to our understanding of the universe.  After review of the proposal and discussions with the PHY Division, the PI descoped the project, submitting a revised budget and proposed to do only activities 2, 3, 4, and 6. <br/><br/>The proposed U.S. effort will be part of a worldwide celebration of Einstein's achievements. The APS hosted an international organizational meeting last spring for the World Year of Physics that attracted some 62 participants from 29 countries.  Germany, France, the U.K, and Switzerland plan programs that are much larger on a per capita basis than that planned by the APS.   <br/><br/>"

The LSU detector has been observing for 2 years.  Its sensitivity to short bursts is now the best ever obtained by any detector anywhere (average burst gravitational strain         2 `     noise is 6x10          19   ), and is probably sufficient to detect the gravitational waves from a supernova within our galaxy.  The LSU group will continue to operate their detector, until they are ready to improve its sensitivity.  Data exchange and searches for coincidences with any other detectors operational will continue.          The LSU group will also investigate a new type of detector with a nearly spherical shape, the Truncated Icosahedral Gravitational wave Antenna, or TIGA.  They have already published calculati ons that predict a 56 fold increase in energy sensitivity for a TIGA detector, compared to the equivalent bar type antenna.  A TIGA system could consist of several omni directional detectors at different frequencies, all designed to work in coincidence with each other and with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational (LIGO).  The LSU group will continue its program to verify the theoretical predictions by experimental measurement on a prototype TIGA.          In collaboration with other U.S. resonant mass detector groups, the LSU gravitational physics group will undertake the detailed design of a TIGA system of gravitational wave detectors.  The goal of the collaborative research effort will be the production, by January of 1995, of a detailed design and a plan for the construction and operation of the system in conjunction with all other gravitational wave detectors in the world. ***"

The investigator will advance our understanding of BHs and NSs by studying their collisions in space. The violent collisions of BHs and NSs produce bursts of light that can be detected with telescopes, as well as gravitational waves (GWs) that can now be detected with special instruments like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). Indeed, astronomers have very recently detected for the first time GWs and light from a neutron star merger named GW170817. This joint detection marked the beginning a new era of investigation: the era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics. New research programs, like the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), are further increasing the distances probed in the Universe and rate of discoveries. The investigator?s project capitalizes on this guaranteed stream of data, adding the unique perspective of a truly multi-wavelength (X-ray to radio) characterization of mergers of NSs and BHs. The investigator will work with high school teachers to develop curricular material on compact-object mergers, and to guide their students in research projects. Finally, the investigator?s group will work with visually impaired scientists and collaborate with professional musicians to translate astronomical measurements into sound to make multi-messenger astrophysics accessible to everybody and engage the wider public with an all-senses experience.<br/> <br/>The field of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics is in its infancy. After the first joint electromagnetic (EM)-GW detection, the research priority is to map the post-merger properties as constrained by the EM transients. This is the overarching goal of this investigation. By acquiring multi-wavelength observations that sample both the thermal and non-thermal emission, this effort will map the diversity of the EM outcomes from NS mergers. In doing so, this investigation will lead to the study of a population of NS mergers detected via GWs and light.   New regimes of high energy and high-density physics will be explored in their research program.  In addition, the investigator may improve constraints on the NS equation of state and on the rate of acceleration of the Universe. This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The work will involve both research and technology training of undergraduate and graduate students. The equipment consists of a large computer cluster (56 nodes, each with two dual-core CPUs) with gigabit networking, designed for high computational efficiency-to-cost ratio for GW source simulations. In addition, 16 of the nodes will be equipped with specialized hardware (GRAPE boards) for direct N-body simulations in stellar dynamics. A major storage component is also part of the proposed system. Visualizations from the simulation results will be developed for use in both research analysis and training as well as for public outreach presentations at the nearby Adler Planetarium. For this development effort will be enabled by the acquisition of a Tiled Wall Display (almost 25 million pixels) operated by a small cluster of 7 nodes with high-level graphics capabilities. All the acquired instrumentation will be used in a wide range of computational astrophysics projects on binary star evolution and compact object formation, stellar dynamics, and hydrodynamics. The results will greatly improve the understanding of the most important GW sources for current laser interferometer detectors, and they will also allow for better physical interpretation of future GW observations. Examples of specific projects include: (i) modeling populations of binary compact objects driven to inspiral by GW emission; the primary goal is the application of empirical constraints to theoretical models and the derivation of reliable predictions for binary inspiral detection rates and for measurements of source properties. (ii) dynamical simulations of black holes in dense star clusters; frequent dynamical interactions in these systems can lead to the formation of large numbers of merging black hole binaries and may be the dominant source of detectable black hole mergers for ground-based interferometers such as LIGO. (iii) hydrodynamic calculations of the final mergers of compact binaries containing a black hole and a neutron star; these will be performed using a sophisticated 3-D relativistic hydrodynamics code and will represent a significant improvement over previous, more approximate treatments based on Newtonian gravity. The study of GW sources is also important in many other areas of astrophysics. For example, coalescing compact binaries may also be sources of gamma-ray bursts, and they may play a key role for the production of many heavy elements in galaxies. The research activities enabled by this instrumentation will involve the training of several undergraduate and graduate students, including students from under-represented minorities. A graduate student studying high performance computing and a team of up to about ten undergraduates will also be trained in all phases of the instrument acquisition, set-up, and commissioning. <br/>"

The project includes further development and application to binary black hole simulations of state-of-the-art techniques from computational physics and applied mathematics. The numerical solution of Einstein's equations has historically posed unique, problems associated with features inherent to Einstein's theory, such as gauge conditions and constraint violations.

At the analytical level the project includes development and application of techniques to deal with constraint instabilities, boundary conditions for Einstein's equations, and coordinate conditions. At the discrete level it includes development and application techniques for multi-patch simulations, high order methods, methods for matching Einstein's equations to perturbative and other modules, constraint projection and variational integrators. The development of the necessary computational infrastructure to apply these techniques will be done in close collaboration with the Cactus development group at LSU.

Despite a wealth of observations across the electromagnetic spectrum over the last four decades, much of what happens in their deep interior remains inscrutable.  Owing to X-ray telescopes such as Chandra, laboratory nuclear experiments, and perhaps in the near future gravitational wave detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO), knowledge of neutron star physics is growing rapidly.  Indeed, the National Academy report, ""Connecting Quarks with the Cosmos: Eleven Science Questions for the New Century"" identified the nature of matter at exceedingly high density and temperature as one of the eleven critical science questions for the twenty-first century.  Moreover, the recent 2010 Decadal Survey ""New Worlds, New Horizons"" identifies as one of its Frontier questions for Stars and Stellar Evolution, ""What controls the mass, radius, and spin of compact stellar remnants?""  The models developed in this project will enable existing and future observations to further our knowledge of the physics of dense matter and stellar evolution.<br/><br/>This project includes activities to recruit the next generation of scientists and to inform the public and provides support of a graduate student for three years.  The project supports an undergraduate to assist with running the codes used in the project, and to assist with testing, maintaining, and posting educational resources using the open-source MESA stellar evolution code.  The PI with assistance from the undergraduate will develop problem sets, plots, and animations using MESA.  Michigan State is a large public institution with a diverse student population and will serve as a testbed for development of these resources.  In particular, the PI will develop problem ""templates"" so that students can more readily use MESA to explore stellar physics.  These tools will be posted on the MESA web forum http://mesastar.org/.  Posting these tools will make it easier for other instructors to adopt MESA for classroom instruction and is expected to motivate others to post their results as well.  For public outreach, the PI will incorporate discoveries made during the tenure of this award into public talks at Michigan State's Abrams Planetarium.<br/><br/>More technically, for neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, in which the neutron star accretes hydrogen- or helium-rich material, there is a wealth of time-dependent phenomena spanning a wide range of timescales.  During accretion, runaway thermonuclear burning of the accreted matter is observable as a Type I X-ray burst.  The thousands of observed X-ray bursts, the rarer and more energetic superbursts, and the cooling transients all encode information about the physics of dense matter, in particular the sub-nuclear-density ""crust"" of the neutron star.  For over a decade the model of the neutron star's crust has been that the three layers influence each other: the short bursts produce the fuel for superbursts, superburst ashes form the outer crust, and nuclear reactions in the crust heat the envelope.  In the last several years, however, evidence has steadily mounted that this picture is at best incomplete, and that additional, strong, shallow---and as yet unidentified---heat sources are present.  This project will generate global models of the neutron star crust with the latest nuclear reaction physics, including a newly discovered neutrino cooling mechanism, and use existing and future observations of cooling transients, superbursts, and X-ray bursts to constrain the depth and strength of additional heating in the crust.  In addition, they will make predictions for the uniqueness of the crust composition as a function of density, which is important for determining the neutron star's thermal and magnetic evolution as well as its ability to sustain a mass quadrupole."

In particular, pulsars can be used to search for gravitational waves - ripples in space-time caused by the acceleration of large masses such as black holes - by monitoring the arrival time of the pulses. This long-term, collaborative effort is one of the great quests of modern physics and astrophysics. The technique employed is sensitive to gravitational waves with light-year wavelengths produced, for example, by orbiting supermassive black holes at the cores of merging galaxies. This wavelength regime cannot be probed by other techniques, for example those being explored by LIGO and the proposed LISA mission. Multi-path propagation through the inhomogeneous interstellar gas - and subsequent interference effects - causes the radio signal to vary in strength or scintillate. Scintillation effects hamper high precision timing of pulsars by introducing random noise into the timing signal. The required timing precision is extraordinary: about 100 ns maintained for years.<br/><br/>The PI and his Oberlin College undergraduate students are developing a technique that allows time delays smaller than a microsecond to be estimated from the time-variable spectrum of the pulsar. Although there is much development work needed on this technique, initial results are promising and underscore the importance of understanding and correcting for this delay. The proposed research will develop this technique in detail using high-sensitivity observations from the Arecibo radio telescope and other large telescopes such as the NRAO/Green Bank Telescope and the LEAP (virtual array) telescope being organized in Europe. The main goal is to focus on this important source of timing noise and develop a practical technique for correcting for it in the timing signal of relatively weak millisecond pulsars.<br/><br/>This research will benefit the scientific community by improving our ability to detect gravitational waves with an array of millisecond pulsars. In addition, what we learn about scattering of radio waves by the ionized gas in the Milky Way will improve our understanding of how the Milky Way ""works,"" for example the degree of turbulence of the interstellar gas is how it is distributed in space. Both of these topics are of interest not only to specialists, but to a much wider audience as well. As a professor at a liberal arts college, the PI shares the excitement of this work with his research students and with the wide range of students he teaches. His teaching of Introductory Astronomy to about 100 undergraduates a year, for example, benefits directly from his involvement in scientific research. This research program will involve undergraduate students in the excitement of exploring a new phenomenon and piecing together parts of a bigger puzzle. By working closely with the PI and his collaborators, the students will gain a broad range of technical skills as well as further develop their ability to independently explore problems. Using state-of-the-art electronics and computers at the largest radio telescopes in the world, the students will gain confidence in their ability to tackle large and complex problems. Opportunities to collaborate with scientists in the U.S. and abroad and to report their work at conferences and in publications will enhance students' research experience and prepare them for graduate training or other roles in the technical workforce."

The program will bring together doctoral students, promising young researchers, and leading experts to discuss spectacular recent developments in the nexus of geometric analysis and general relativity, to assess new avenues for investigations, to support existing collaborations, and to promote new ones.  In recent years, gravitational wave experiments such as that of LIGO have seen striking advances, confirming phenomena anticipated by general relativity (Einstein's theory of gravitation).  These developments have led to a new surge of activity in the study of cosmological models, black holes, and other areas in the field.  The summer school is designed to introduce aspects of the field to graduate students and other junior investigators, and at the conference participants will learn about a range of current research questions.  The ESI program affords young researchers the opportunity to enhance the development of their research program through interaction with established and emerging leaders in the field.  This grant will provide support for graduate students and other junior investigators from the U.S. interested in attending the conference and/or summer school, and who would otherwise be unable to do so without this support.  <br/><br/>The study of the Einstein equations as a model for gravitational phenomena involves deep and fundamental relationships between geometric analysis and physics.  Spectacular progress has been made in recent years on several fronts, including the study of wave equations on black hole space-times (with the eventual goal of understanding black hole stability), cosmic censorship, dynamical formation of black holes in vacuum, topology of black holes, and a better understanding of the moduli space of solutions to the Einstein constraint equations that govern geometry of initial data for the Cauchy problem.  Recent advances in numerical analysis of gravitational phenomena highlight the need to push the theoretical boundaries of the initial value formulation (both in constructing solutions to the constraints and in understanding the evolution of these initial data sets) and to create a bridge between the researchers in these areas.  The purpose of the summer school and conference is to introduce graduate students and other junior investigators to the tools needed to approach such results and to frame some outstanding open problems in the field.

Rather than dealing with lasers, photons at optical frequencies, and individual real atoms, the PI studies microwave photons and artificial atoms constructed from superconducting circuit elements. Because the artificial atoms (called qubits) are enormously larger than individual real atoms, their interaction with photons can be significantly larger than the interaction between ordinary light and atoms. This permits testing the implications of quantum mechanics in completely new regimes, as well as creating exotic quantum states of qubits and photons, which can be used as the basis for building a quantum computer and for secure quantum communication based on the transmission of photons. This project will also develop and study methods for storing and faithfully transmitting quantum information using photons, even if photons are lost during transmission over long distances or during storage over long periods of time in a quantum memory. <br/><br/>Because of recent enormous experimental progress, it is now possible to detect individual photons with unprecedented sensitivity. This project will take advantage of these advances to propose methods that will dramatically speed up the search for a certain class of dark matter particles known as axions, which will forge important new connections between the fields of condensed matter physics and cosmology.<br/><br/>Finally, the PI will continue his collaboration with experimental colleagues to study quantum optomechanics, in which the feeble radiation pressure of light is harnessed to control the motion of mechanical objects, and make position measurements with unprecedented accuracy.

Thus, many modes are jointly coupled to the qubit and hence to each other.<br/><br/>2) Efficient Detection of Microwave Photons for Axion Searches and Remote Entanglement: This project will propose and develop novel methods to use tools from circuit QED to detect cosmological axion dark-matter particles. Two different schemes will be analyzed, the first using two-mode squeezers to amplify the axion signal without amplifying the vacuum noise, and the second using recently developed capabilities for quantum non-demolition detection of microwave photons to create a ""photomultiplier"" for microwave photons. The PI will develop an optimal Bayesian filter to minimize the dark count rate of the detector and hence dramatically increase the signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of axions relative to current methods. The same ideas can be applied to the remote entanglement of qubits in independent cavities, which will have important application in the development of quantum computers.<br/><br/>3) Error Correctable Photonic Codes for Quantum Memories and Communication: This project sits within fundamental quantum information theory. It will take advantage of new experimental capabilities, which allow essentially universal control and measurement of complex superpositions of Fock states of small numbers of microwave photons and superconducting qubits, and have no analog in ordinary optics. The PI will develop approximate continuous quantum error correction protocols for bosonic modes. These will have applications to using microwave resonators as quantum memories, to quantum communication using microwave photons, and to faithful conversion of quantum information stored in microwave photons up to optical frequencies where it can be transmitted large distances over fiber networks.<br/><br/>4) Optomechanics: This is a fundamental quantum optics collaboration with experimental colleagues at Yale. The PI is particularly interested in the development of a fully quantum theory of non-adiabatic evolution near so-called ""exceptional points"" in the parameter space. <br/><br/>The project will achieve broader impacts by its interdisciplinary nature and the close collaboration with experiment. The PI is fostering communication among the condensed matter, atomic physics, quantum optics and electrical engineering communities. As part of the project a postdoctoral fellow will be trained in cutting-edge theoretical methods. The PI is also responsible for an annual lecture for approximately 200 high-school students from across New England as part of the Yale Physics Olympics, focused on explaining ideas from quantum mechanics and quantum information processing."

String theory aims to describe the nature of the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at the very highest energies, and string phenomenology aims to develop connections between the ideas of string theory and those of more traditional particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.   As such, these conferences attract physicists and mathematicians representing a diverse international community and provide a venue in which they can discuss and present recent developments and challenges in this exciting interdisciplinary field.  The sixteenth iteration of this conference series will be particularly important and timely, given recent important experimental results from the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva, from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), as well as a plethora of new results from the mathematical literature.   As such, support for this series of meetings serves the national interest by promoting basic science in the United States.   This grant is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  These conferences bring together talented researchers from a diverse range of institutions and backgrounds, and special effort is made to incorporate the work of junior researchers and members of under-represented groups."

Several groups have now demonstrated very significant cooling of the vibrational motion of a broad range of moving mirrors, from nanoscale cantilevers to LIGO-class mirrors, and there is every reason to believe that their quantum mechanical ground state of motion of these systems will soon be achieved. In a parallel development, ultracold gases as well as Bose-Einstein condensates placed inside optical resonators have been shown to behave under appropriate conditions much like moving mirrors. Cavity optomechanics is rapidly becoming a very active sub-field or fundamental and applied research at the boundary between AMO physics, condensed matter physics, and nanoscience.  With these breakthrough developments in mind, the main goal of this research is to develop a detailed theoretical understanding of key aspects of cavity optomechanics, including in particular the dynamics of mirror cooling, and to study a number of applications that include novel quantum sensors as well as the quantum and coherent control of ultracold atomic and molecular systems.<br/><br/>Cavity optomechanics presents considerable promise both in opening the way to address fundamental questions related to pushing quantum mechanics toward increasingly macroscopic systems, but also in applications that span a variety of areas from quantum detection to the coherent control of microscopic systems and/or of nanoscale devices. On the applied side it will enable the development of ultrasensitive force sensors and may find applications in quantum information processing technology. In addition, the study of these problems is an excellent training ground for students in view of their interdisciplinary nature at the interface of several subfields of considerable fundamental and practical interest."

The rest, whose presence we only infer gravitationally, is unknown in its nature, and is termed Cold Dark Matter, for which a particle called a light axion is a well-motivated candidate. Should axions constitute the dark matter of our Milky Way halo, they may be detected through their conversion into a narrow Radio Frequency (RF) signal in a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field. The experiment being performed at Yale, ADMX-HF (Axion Dark Matter eXperiment - High Frequency), was designed to serve both as an innovation test-bed to develop and transition new cavity designs and quantum-limited photon detection schemes, and as a pathfinder to take first data in the 10-100 micro-electron Volt mass range. <br/><br/>R&D on superconducting thin-films, and squeezed-state and single-photon detection in quantum electronics will produce unanticipated spin-offs. ADMX-HF has proven to be a great attractor for young talent. This award can be expected to extend this record. In addition, it is planned to establish a permanent exhibit on dark-sector science at the Chabot Space and Science Center, or the Oakland Museum of California, utilizing prototypes and artifacts from many of the historic dark matter, dark energy and cosmic microwave background experiments.<br/><br/>UC Berkeley and U. Colorado/JILA are assisting Yale by taking the lead on cavity and amplifier development, respectively. The three universities have successfully delivered on ADMX-HF, which recently performed its first data run. This represented the inaugural use of Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs) in the microwave cavity experiment, and operation with a dilution refrigerator. With this award, Berkeley and Colorado plan two lines of R&D: (i) Berkeley will pursue boosting the cavity Q by incorporating multilayer structures of thin-film superconductors into the cavity design, as well as exploring Photonic Band Gap (PBG) structures as practical resonators for higher frequency operation; and (ii) Colorado/JILA will focus on reducing amplifier noise below the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), initially by incorporating a JPA-based squeezed-vacuum state receiver. This would be only the second application of a squeezed-state receiver, beside the GEO/LIGO gravity wave interferometers. Later, photon detector systems based on superconducting qubits inside of a cavity will be developed and deployed. Technical deliverables anticipated are to (a) extend the mass range of the search to 12 GHz (~50 micro-eV), and (b) deliver an improvement in power sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and thus approach sensitivity to Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axions. This will dramatically improve the discovery potential of the axion search in the most promising mass region."

To deal with the complexity and richness of the Einstein theory when applied to realistic astrophysical phenomena, simultaneous advances in computation, visualization, and numerical algorithms will be developed.  To deal with the complexity of the resulting simulation code and the range of problems to which it can be applied, a simulation-centered ""collaboratory"" will be developed that can support a large user and developer community and that will reduce the barriers to experimentation and exploration.  The development of this simulation collaboratory will be driven by the astrophysically significant problem of the collapse of a neutron star to a black hole induced by accretion of mass from its surroundings.  The problem will be studied in the Einstein theory of general relativity with relativistic hydrodynamics and nuclear astrophysics also incorporated, and making use of all major components in the collaboratory.<br/><br/>The impact of the project will be in the new frontiers of gravitational-wave astronomy and high energy (gamma-ray and X-ray) astronomies.

Einstein@Home is one of the largest and most powerful computers on the planet. It searches astrophysical data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars. Unlike a normal supercomputer, the computing power of Einstein@Home comes from ordinary home computers and laptops that have been ""signed up"" by about 300,000 members of the general public.  When otherwise idle, these computers automatically download observational data over the Internet from Einstein@Home servers, search the data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars, and return the results of the analysis to the servers.<br/><br/>Neutron stars are exotic objects: they represent the most compact form that a star can take before it collapses into a black hole.  Since they were discovered in 1967, about two thousand neutron stars have been found (including several discovered in 2010 and 2011 by Einstein@Home).  Neutron star observations provide a unique view into the behavior of matter at extreme pressures and densities, and into the nature of gravitation when gravity is very strong.  Under certain circumstances, neutron stars can be emitters of pulsing radio waves (pulsars). Einstein@home exploits the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope in the world, to search for these signals. It is possible that neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 but have never been directly detected. Einstein@home can search the data from gravitational wave detectors such as those of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for these signals. Einstein@home also supports the BOINC software infrastructure to benefit dozens of computationally intensive projects in other areas of science, that also exploit volunteer distributed computing. And it is a remarkable tool for scientific outreach: Einstein@Home allows hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens from around the world to participate in and make meaningful contribution to cutting-edge scientific research."

To do this, the gravitational-wave group at Montclair State University will implement improved waveform templates focusing on (i) binaries with precessing spins, (ii) tidal interactions in binaries containing neutron stars, and (iii) binaries with small orbital eccentricity. These improved templates will be used to quantify the amount of systematic bias in our estimates of the GW source parameters. This bias arises from uncertainties in our knowledge of the actual GW signal.  We will also test the effectiveness of simple waveform templates that will search for the GW ""memory"" effect. The memory is a non-oscillatory piece of the GW signal that is particularly evident in signals from supernova explosions and binary black hole collisions.<br/><br/>Gravitational wave detection provides a new and powerful way to observe some of the most violent events in the universe: the collisions of black holes and neutron stars. Observing these collisions with GWs will test our understanding of Einstein's theory of gravity and also probe aspects of nuclear physics that are inaccessible in terrestrial laboratories (such as the nature of ultra-dense matter). This award will advance the effort to model and understand these collisions with high accuracy. Much of this work will involve the education and training of undergraduate and graduate students. By applying physics, mathematics, computation, and critical thinking to an important scientific problem, these students will acquire technical skills that are in increasingly high demand.

A science with the longest history of ""big"" science, however, is oceanography.  Even today, NSF and NOAA must spend millions of dollars to construct oceanographic vessels and equipment.  Expeditions remain extremely expensive.  Yet nations have invested in major ocean-going scientific expeditions for at least three centuries.  The ostensible reason for these expeditions is the advance of knowledge and the concomitant economic development that comes from scientific knowledge.   Yet even today, these voyages serve political and commercial as well as scientific purposes.  Ocean margin drilling, for example, not only advances our understanding of the ocean floors but tells us what minerals may be on the ocean floor that our companies might ""mine"" and supports our positions in the negotiations over Law of the Sea treaties.    Mr. Kellman, under the direction of Dr. Geison, is examining the wave of French scientific voyages that charted the Pacific and southern oceans.  His focus is an analysis of the scientific projects planned in Paris and carried out on board, using the wealth of unpublished logbooks and other manuscript sources.  He is exploring the meaning of science for these voyages, looking for the way individual disciplines, as well as general methodology interacted with the various forces behind the expedition. He sees these voyages in the greater context of the political, commercial and philosophical aims of French overseas exploration and development.    The scientific results of these voyages often reflect the diversity of forces behind them.  In natural history, a new focus on the varieties of humans led to the emergence of anthropology. In hydrography and geography, new methods and standards of mathematical r igor were adopted.  A new ethos of quantification and precision served as both a motivation and a result of these expeditions.  This project will give a new sense to the term ""scientific voyages"" and show how ""science"" came to stand for a particular approach and set of methods, equally useful to the academies, to the state, and to commerce."

Many of the processes leading up to these explosions are understood in principle, but much can be learned about the progenitor stars of these explosions by studying how different classes of explosions are distributed across galaxy types, galaxy environments, and cosmic age. The team will build upon the successful Galaxy Evolution (GALEV) stellar population models and study, for a variety of stellar explosions, how each of them depends on the age, mass, and chemical properties of their host galaxy. In addition to advancing our understanding of where most of the vitally important elements come from, this will also greatly benefit the full scientific exploitation of major US investments, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. A connected public education and outreach effort focuses on demonstrating how astronomers extract scientific insights from ""pretty pictures."" Supplemented with public talks and stargazing events, this generates enthusiasm amongst young students for the science fields.<br/><br/><br/>Explosive transients such as Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts are tracers of the final stage of stellar evolution that shape the evolution of the host galaxy by regulating the gas inflows and outflows and by enriching the interstellar medium with metals. Observationally, recent and future advances in instrumentation -- many with major US support such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and Advanced-LIGO -- allow us to gather sizable samples of these rare events across a wide range of host galaxy properties. Though the qualitative theoretical base for most events are well established, current theoretical models cannot yet predict a priori the distribution of events across redshift, galaxy type, galaxy mass, etc. In this project, the team will extend the successful Galaxy Evolution (GALEV) synthesis code to model the rate of events from single- and binary-star progenitors, fully and self-consistently accounting for both the evolution of metallicity and stellar populations in galaxies. This approach allows the researchers to study the host galaxies of explosive transients individually and hence to better constrain the physical processes underlying these events. The team will develop a series of presentations for the Manfred Olson Planetarium aimed at school groups, the campus community, and the general public to illustrate astronomical methods and techniques in an easy-to-understand, audience-appropriate way. Members of the team will also run astronomy shows by taking telescopes to parks and public events in the south-east Wisconsin region to offer stargazing and casual interactions with fellow citizens across all ages and backgrounds."

In particular, the groups wish to employ personnel to upgrade the network system, to increase the redundancy of the network by adding servers and to provide on-call physicists with communication devices.<br/><br/>In the education/outreach area, SNEWS already involves both graduate and undergraduate students. However, this proposal is devoted to developing the amateur astronomer community as an integral part of the early warning system, since it is very likely that the location of a new supernova will be pinpointed first by an amateur. Specifically, the groups plan to recruit members of the general public, including both experts and novices in astronomy.<br/>"

These simulations require initial conditions: solutions to the initial value problem of general relativity for the coupled gravity-matter system. The conformal thin sandwich method is an excellent approach for solving the initial value problem; however, although not an intrinsic assumption of the method, in practice the approach has assumed conformal flatness (as have other valuable approaches). Conformal flatness yields unphysical junk radiation. By numerically constructing helically symmetric solutions to the Einstein equations, the PI will extract initial data (or conformal thin sandwich trial data) which does not rely on conformal flatness, and therefore contains the correct initial gravitational wave content. The mixed PDEs arising from the helical reduction of the Einstein equations (or their approximation in the post-Minkowski formalism) will be solved with innovative techniques: sparse modal spectral-tau methods with new preconditioning strategies. In part, these strategies may rely on randomized algorithms for the interpolative decomposition. Spectral methods deliver superb accuracy for smooth problems(neutron star spacetimes are smooth almost everywhere), and sparsity affords a fast matrix-vector multiply when using a Krylov-subspace method to iteratively solve a linear system. Whereas the preconditioning of nodal (collocation) spectral methods is well studied, less is known about modal preconditioning. Our techniques have been successfully applied to models of the binary neutron star problem. Moreover, the problem's physical structure has already been explored with different, but limited, techniques. <br/><br/>This project is to combine two sets of techniques (each already developed) and further develop the first set (spectral-tau methods), in order to obtain new results for a leading problem in gravitational wave physics. The PI will develop these mathematical methods by applying them to the specific neutron star problem described above. This strategy of specificity is often used in the development of techniques, which then prove to be more general. Because the scientific problem is of great interest, much is known about it, and results therefore exist withwhich comparisons can be made. These comparisons facilitate the development of mathematical algorithms. Conversely, new mathematical methods deliver more and/or better solutions which enhances scientific understanding."

That is, the corresponding  linear time evolutions cannot be effectively   compared at each fixed time to the initial data   using a single L-p space (Lebesgue space with exponent p)   when p is not equal to 2.  (When p = 2, there is often a conservation of   energy which provides just such an estimate.)         This obstacle is present in equations ranging from   classical field theory to the higher dimensional analogues of   hyperbolic systems dealt with in 1 space dimension by Glimm's method.   We propose to study two analytical methods developed to deal with  L-p ill-posedness in the context of nonlinear wave equations and   nonlinear Schrodinger equations.  The first is space-time estimates  for the corresponding linear problems.  We propose to study in collaboration   with T. Tao the endpoint  Strichartz estimates  for the Schrodinger and wave equation in   space dimensions 2 and 3, respectively.  This would be an extension of   previous work by Tao and the author.    We propose second to study generalized Sobolev estimates and the   method of conformal compactification.  We will be  looking, in   collaboration with C. Sogge and H. Smith, at the   specific problem of global in time existence for a   system of quasilinear wave equations  with small initial data   in the exterior of an obstacle.    Finally, we would like to bring these techniques to the question of   how the choice of gauge affects regularity of the solution in the   context of the hyperbolic Yang-Mills equations.     The physics behind many interesting systems currently   being investigated (for example, fluid flow or the   LIGO gravitational wave detectors) leads scientists to  a number of very difficult questions in nonlinear mathematics.   When we consider the nonlinear partial differential  equations arising in fluid mechanics and general  relativity, some   natural questions are ""how big is a solution at long times"" or even   ""does a solution exist for all times"". We have only very incomplete   answers to these questions.   The present proposal aims to further understand promising techniques   in nonlinear hyperbolic pde which might eventually be brought to   physical systems.  For example, the question above   regarding endpoint Strichartz estimates may shed light  on the decay properties of waves.  The obstacle problem mentioned   above is a toy model for the stability of the Schwarzschild space   in general relativity."

When otherwise idle, these computers automatically download observational data over the Internet from Einstein@Home servers, search the data for the weak signals from spinning neutron stars, and return the results of the analysis to the servers.<br/><br/>Neutron stars are exotic objects: they represent the most compact form that a star can take before it collapses into a black hole.  Since they were discovered in 1967, about two thousand neutron stars have been found (including several discovered in 2010 and 2011 by Einstein@Home).  Neutron star observations provide a unique view into the behavior of matter at extreme pressures and densities, and into the nature of gravitation when gravity is very strong.  Under certain circumstances, neutron stars can be emitters of pulsing radio waves (pulsars). Einstein@home exploits the unique capabilities of the Arecibo Radio Observatory, the largest and most sensitive single-dish radio telescope in the world, to search for these signals. It is possible that neutron stars can also emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were first predicted by Einstein in 1917 but have never been directly detected. Einstein@home can search the data from gravitational wave detectors such as those of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) for these signals. Einstein@home also supports the BOINC software infrastructure to benefit dozens of computationally intensive projects in other areas of science, that also exploit volunteer distributed computing. And it is a remarkable tool for scientific outreach: Einstein@Home allows hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens from around the world to participate in and make meaningful contribution to cutting-edge scientific research."

The existence of gravitational waves was first proposed at the beginning of this century.  Since there was no experimental or observational effect which called for explanation to justify their invention, the motivation seems to have been purely that of establishing a symmetry between gravitational theory and the unified electric and magnetic fields.  Work was to continue throughout the century on developing the concept, despite the continuing absence of any experimental data until the 1970's. Undaunted, the theorists engaged in intense debate on the question of whether the radiation actually existed.  Although some criticism was leveled at the discipline for being so divorced from experimental ""reality,"" ironically the usual outside criticism was that the existence of gravitational radiation was being doubted without sufficient cause.  It is this debate about the existence of gravity waves that has led to the biggest ""big science"" project at the National Science Foundation in a number of years:  the gravity wave detector known as ""LIGO.""    The purpose of this research is to examine the history of this controversy from the late 1930's to the early 1980's, especially in the light of current issues in the history and sociology of science.  It offers a unique opportunity to witness the construction, deconstruction and reconstruction of a ""physical"" phenomenon entirely within a relatively small and purely theoretical community."

In many cases, rapid dissemination and follow-up observation is the key to discovery, to get magnitudes and multi-wavelength coverage.<br/><br/>The new VOEventNet will ingest events from multiple event surveys, professional and amateur and disseminate them for free at all levels, from child to major observatory. Trigger (selection) criteria can be built precisely and individually. When an event arrives, these triggers (boolean functions) are run to decide if an action is to happen or not. These triggers will work with heterogeneous, multi-sourced data. Actions can include the moving and operating of a sensor, either human or robot guided, sending messages, fetching data to build a data portfolio, and running classification rules. Further, actions can cause the generation of new events, thus inducing a workflow. Events come in real time from an automated pipeline of a major sky survey or from a small college observatory or amateur astronomer doing follow-up observations. These authors have previously registered the semantic meaning of the parameters that will be used in the actual events, so that automated systems can be effective, real-time, semantically aware decision-makers. The new VOEventNet will use an international standard (VOEvent) to be part of the global event infrastructure, exchanging events with other event brokers, such as NASA's GCN.<br/><br/>Broader Impact:<br/>We propose here a cyber-infrastructure for events that are created from real-time sensors. The sensor could be many things, for example a radiation detector at a port. Excess click rate of the Geiger counter creates an event that is automatically assembled with other data, such as country of origin, and decisions made, perhaps using an additional sensor, the results triggering another action. Only important events merit human attention. This ""Sensor-Event-Action"" pattern occurs in many other fields of science and engineering, for example early earthquake warning, network provisioning when an internet story becomes viral, leak or pollution detection, and many others."

Their silicon implementation will expedite global deployment of the wireless networks due to its low cost. For this reason, design of silicon RF transceivers has been a dynamic field of research past years. Despite the severe limitations imposed by the silicon technology, the research endeavor significantly advanced the state-of-the-art. Looking back on this past advance and anticipating the further advancement, it is deemed necessary now to address the fundamental limits and their underlying physical mechanisms in the silicon RF transceiver design, with which the proposed research is concerned. This research on statistical and soliton electronics, involving both theory and experiment, is ultimately aimed at leveraging the physical understanding to cutting-edge circuit innovations.<br/><br/>Statistical electronics spans circuit design and statistical physics to tackle noise problems in RF receivers. Harnessing stochastic physics for innovative circuit design, the proposed research will focus on a novel phase noise self-quenching effect and its application to low noise oscillator design. On a fundamental level, the PI will undertake research on thermodynamics of oscillators and data converters. The research also includes application of stochastic resonance to design of wireless transceivers, where noise will play a constructive role.<br/><br/>Soliton electronics concerned with overcoming speed limitations is an interdisciplinary investigation in the borderline of nonlinear science and circuit engineering. Soliton electronics utilizes pulse squeezing and soliton propagation in nonlinear transmission lines (NLTL) to generate and control ultra sharp pulses. The specific objectives consist of the NLTL characterization and design of NLTL-based self-sustained ultra sharp pulse generators.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this research lies in providing understanding of the fundamental difficulties facing the continued expansion of the wireless networks. The proposed research will also add a new dimension to the integrated transceiver design, and high-speed electronics in general. The research is expected to broadly impact scientific instrumentation requiring ultra sensitivity such as LIGO.<br/><br/>The principal investigator plans to train undergraduate and graduate students at interdisciplinary work in the area of statistical electronics and soliton electronics. The aim is to educate students to view progress in science and engineering from a broader perspective, appreciating the relationships across the disciplines.<br/><br/>"

Each stage utilizes  active and passive isolation to achieve the performance  goals.  The preliminary stage is operational, and the two  main stages are under construction.  Early measurements have  been made on the first main stage.  The preliminary, single  stage, vibration isolation system provides more isolation at  1 Hz than any other research or commercial isolation system.  When complete, the three-stage system will provide the  quietest terrestrial environment ever achieved.  The  continuum thermal noise in suspension pendulums, like those  planned for gravitational wave interferometers, will be  measured by hanging a matched pair of them from the ultra  quiet second main stage and determining their relative  motion.    This advanced active vibration isolation system is being  developed to shield sensitive measurement instruments from  the effects of seismic and man-made vibration noise at  frequencies down to 1 Hz.  The objective of this work is to  develop techniques which can help reduce the effects of the  direct mechanical coupling of ground motions and other  vibration on the test masses of gravitational wave  interferometers down to the level of the gravitational  coupling of disturbances to the test masses over as wide a  frequency range as possible.  During the third year of work,  a conceptual design will be developed for an active  vibration isolation system which could be used in advanced  low-frequency LIGO detectors.  This will include a numerical  model of the expected performance.  Improved performance at  frequencies down to 1 Hz would permit searches for signals  which terminate at frequencies of 10 Hz or less."

Its objectives are:  to develop a numerical algorithm and software to compute elastic Green's functions for arbitrarily shaped bodies made of anisotropic materials; and to apply the methodology to thermal noise estimations of gravitational wave receivers.<br/><br/>There are several other programs around the world aiming to detect astrophysical gravitational waves by laser interferometry.  Their basic idea is to measure the relative displacements of suspended mirrors (or test masses) induced by the passage of gravitational waves using a highly sensitive laser interferometer.  Thermally induced surface vibration of the mirror bodies is a major noise source in such a detector.  Understanding this important noise source is one of the crucial research areas of the LSC.  The ability to calculate the thermal noise for different test mass shapes and sizes should be developed.  Dr. Nakagawa has recently obtained a general formula and a computational scheme that enable accurate and efficient computations of thermally induced elastic vibrations of mirror objects.  The formula expresses thermal displacement fluctuations in terms of the two key quantities, i.e., complex elastic stiffness and elastic Green's function.

The PI proposes to study both of these outstanding problems, within a new framework that extends the conventional approach and which uses observational analysis for guidance on these phenomena and for the testable predictions of the program. The radical departure of the PI's approach from the conventional approach is that it proposes to use the quantum dynamics of the gravitational and matter fields degrees of, in a multiverse framework, for selecting the IC and for extracting the cosmological implications of the landscape. The PI advocates that the only way to address the problem meaningfully is by extending our investigation to a multiverse framework. This proposal is one way resolving the puzzle of why our universe had to start with High Energy Big Bang, while avoiding paradoxes born out of previous attempts. This approach also offers a multitude of testable predictions, tracked down by superhorizon entanglement modes, thereby placing it as a strong candidate for a scientific theory of IC. Three of these predictions are already successfully tested, with the most recent test being the NASA discovery of a ""dark flow"" in Sept.2008. Another topic of research concerns the puzzle: what is Dark Energy? Currently, the best way to tell is by observationally finding ways to measure its pressure and equation of state w[z].<br/>Although ranked among the highest priorities in the community, this measurement has proven difficult so far. The PI proposes a complementary method, namely the use of Gravitational Waves from SBH binaries for pinning down w. This method can be quite powerful since it avoids the noise in the signal that is inherited from the vastness of structure through which the signal propagates. Besides complementing current large-scale surveys, the benefit of this method is that we can start taking data immediately and make use of existing and planned LIGO and LISA experiments. The project has many broader impacts. The PI shares the excitement of her research by giving a series of talks nationally and internationally, and by talking to media in order to help make cutting edge research accessible to a wider audience.  Together with Brian Greene and J.Khoury, the PI has initiated and is co-organizing a series of conferences, ""A Debate in Cosmology"", on these outstanding topics, meant not only to stimulate progress and breakthroughs by bringing together authorities in the field, but also for disseminating knowledge by having online video-cams of the talks. She is also co-editing a book on Time's Arrow (NYAS) and co-authoring invited chapters for Springer's ""Frontier"" collection meant to disseminate cutting edge research to the general public."

Today we are on the verge of another revolution in astronomy, as a new generation of observatories prepare to make the first detections of an entirely new spectrum of radiation: gravitational waves. This project will advance the fields of both radio and gravitational-wave astronomy through a series of coordinated observations between the world's largest radio observatories (the Arecibo and Green Bank radio telescopes), and the most sensitive gravitational-wave observatories (the LIGO and Virgo detectors). One component of the project is to perform detailed radio measurements of exotic compact rapidly-spinning stars known as radio pulsars. A second component would be to perform rapid radio follow-up observations of any detected bursts of gravitational radiation, such as might accompany the collisions of compact stars and black holes.<br/><br/>By obtaining precise data on known radio sources that may also be gravitational sources, one can dramatically increase the sensitivity of gravitational-wave searches targeting these objects. Meanwhile, if a putative gravitational-wave burst is accompanied by radio emissions, this will significantly improve confidence in the reality of these early gravitational-wave detections. Both types of observation will hasten the advent of gravitational-wave astronomy, giving complementary views of some of the strangest phenomena in the Universe. These observations will be performed by a specially-trained cadre of student observers recruited from the Lower Rio Grande Valley, providing unprecedented educational and technical opportunities to the academically underrepresented and economically disadvantaged community of this region."

They were first predicted to exist by Einstein in 1916, but because they are weakened by traveling incredibly large distances before reaching Earth, they have not yet been detected. Presently, a number of countries are completing the construction of detectors which might finally see gravitational waves, including the NSF-funded LIGO detectors. The gravitational waves which should be most easily detected by such instruments will come from colliding black holes. Unfortunately, even these events are likely to be undetectable without powerful techniques to extract the gravitational wave data from the instrumental noise. The research funded by this award will use cutting-edge computer simulations to provide partial, but vital, information about the gravitational waves from colliding black holes. This information will then be used to develop powerful new techniques for detecting the gravitational wave signals.<br/><br/>The confirmation of Einstein's prediction of gravitational waves is a laudable scientific objective in itself. However, there is also a much greater promise. Gravitational waves can be produced by objects, like black holes, that cannot be directly observed in any other way. Because so little is known about such objects, it is almost certain that new insights into their origins and workings will result from observing them directly for the first time. Furthermore, it is widely believed that gravitational waves will reveal aspects of the universe that have not yet even been conceived of, thus revolutionizing the current picture of the nature of the cosmos itself. While this revolution will take years to realize, this award enables the important<br/>first step of predicting what should be sought and how to seek it."

Many of the processes leading up to these explosions are understood in principle, but much can be learned about the progenitor stars of these explosions by studying how different classes of explosions are distributed across galaxy types, galaxy environments, and cosmic age. The team will build upon the successful Galaxy Evolution (GALEV) stellar population models and study, for a variety of stellar explosions, how each of them depends on the age, mass, and chemical properties of their host galaxy. In addition to advancing our understanding of where most of the vitally important elements come from, this will also greatly benefit the full scientific exploitation of major US investments, such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. A connected public education and outreach effort focuses on demonstrating how astronomers extract scientific insights from ""pretty pictures."" Supplemented with public talks and stargazing events, this generates enthusiasm amongst young students for the science fields.<br/><br/><br/>Explosive transients such as Supernovae and Gamma-Ray Bursts are tracers of the final stage of stellar evolution that shape the evolution of the host galaxy by regulating the gas inflows and outflows and by enriching the interstellar medium with metals. Observationally, recent and future advances in instrumentation -- many with major US support such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and Advanced-LIGO -- allow us to gather sizable samples of these rare events across a wide range of host galaxy properties. Though the qualitative theoretical base for most events are well established, current theoretical models cannot yet predict a priori the distribution of events across redshift, galaxy type, galaxy mass, etc. In this project, the team will extend the successful Galaxy Evolution (GALEV) synthesis code to model the rate of events from single- and binary-star progenitors, fully and self-consistently accounting for both the evolution of metallicity and stellar populations in galaxies. This approach allows the researchers to study the host galaxies of explosive transients individually and hence to better constrain the physical processes underlying these events. The team will develop a series of presentations for the Manfred Olson Planetarium aimed at school groups, the campus community, and the general public to illustrate astronomical methods and techniques in an easy-to-understand, audience-appropriate way. Members of the team will also run astronomy shows by taking telescopes to parks and public events in the south-east Wisconsin region to offer stargazing and casual interactions with fellow citizens across all ages and backgrounds."

These detectors are expected to make the first direct observations of gravitational waves and herald the birth of GW astronomy by harnessing information on the distribution of the sources in the sky, distance, masses, and spins. These observations may also shed light on the nature of the host galaxies of CBCs. This project will also support work on aLIGO commissioning and instrumentation at the Hanford site, and the development of rapid detector characterization techniques and tools. To catch a prompt electromagnetic or neutrino emission from a CBC it is critical that the duty factors of the GW detectors be high for sky localization, and detector characterization and background estimation be rapid so that robust GW alerts can be communicated to electromagnetic and neutrino observatories.<br/><br/>Rapid detector characterization will facilitate the publishing of gravitational-wave data to the public, with robust data quality flags in hand. This project will also engage the faculty of the Washington State University campuses in Pullman and Tri-Cities in education and outreach on gravitational-wave science. The latter campus caters to a large percentage of Hispanic and Native-American populations, both of which are under-represented, and offers a rare setting for integrating university education with cutting-edge research in gravitation being carried out at a nearby lab."

As each new instrument is added, a whole new range of discoveries have been made. The last major instrument to be added to astronomy was the radio telescope. One of the major arguments for the development of LIGO, NSF's new ""big science"" instrument for the measurement of the hypothesized gravity waves, is that if it is successful, it will provide a new instrument for examining the universe. We can only conjecture how this new instrument may transform our understanding of the heavens. Despite the importance of instrumentation in the astronomy, most histories have examined the theoretical development of this science. Professor Sharma is thus leading the way in a new kind of study of the history of astronomy. In fact, Professor Sharma's study is exemplary in another respect as well: not only is it a study of instrumentation, but it is the study of instrumentation in a non-Western scientific tradition. If we are to understand fully the impact of instrumentation on science, we must understand its impact on science, wherever it is undertaken. Rare, however, is the person who can carry out this kind of research. Fortunately, Professor Sharma has not only the technical scientific skills to understand what is going on in the science, but also the language skills to pursue this subject. He is examining the development of Hindu observational astronomy and its impact not only in India, but also on Western astronomy as well. He is comparing Indian astronomical instruments with Western and Islamic instruments of observation and is investigating their similarities and differences in construction, use and purpose. Thus his study will shed light on the development of Hindu astronomy as well as its mutual interaction with Western and Islamic astronomy. This kind of study is essential if we are t o understand how science develops in society."

The research will have two distinct components: (1) participation in practical software implementations of searches for signals from astrophysical sources (about 60%), and (2) theoretical calculations of expected gravitational-wave signals from highly relativistic orbiting binary star systems (about 40%). The first is highly collaborative research and will include taking on the duties of ``Software Coordinator'' for LIGO Scientific collaboration (LSC), as well conducting Mock Data Challenges to test the software and algorithms being implemented. The second part is largely an independent effort to study the nature of radiation reaction effects in curved space time. This, in turn leads to better theoretical understanding of the astrophysical sources that produce the radiation. Together these form a healthy mix of practical and theoretical research, as well as collaborative and independent work.<br/><br/>Over the past ten years Wiseman has participated in a broad collaboration to use post-Newtonian techniques to calculate the chirp waveform produced by binary star systems (e.g. pairs of neutron stars or black holes). In recent years, he has broadened his efforts to to study the problem of radiation in curved spacetime. Continuation of these efforts will improve our quantitative understanding of the signals produced by highly relativistic inspiralling coalescing binaries. This, in turn, improves our ability to find these signal buried in detector noise."

These simulations require initial conditions: solutions to the initial value problem of general relativity for the coupled gravity-matter system. The conformal thin sandwich method is an excellent approach for solving the initial value problem; however, although not an intrinsic assumption of the method, in practice the approach has assumed conformal flatness (as have other valuable approaches). Conformal flatness yields unphysical junk radiation. By numerically constructing helically symmetric solutions to the Einstein equations, the PI will extract initial data (or conformal thin sandwich trial data) which does not rely on conformal flatness, and therefore contains the correct initial gravitational wave content. The mixed PDEs arising from the helical reduction of the Einstein equations (or their approximation in the post-Minkowski formalism) will be solved with innovative techniques: sparse modal spectral-tau methods with new preconditioning strategies. In part, these strategies may rely on randomized algorithms for the interpolative decomposition. Spectral methods deliver superb accuracy for smooth problems(neutron star spacetimes are smooth almost everywhere), and sparsity affords a fast matrix-vector multiply when using a Krylov-subspace method to iteratively solve a linear system. Whereas the preconditioning of nodal (collocation) spectral methods is well studied, less is known about modal preconditioning. Our techniques have been successfully applied to models of the binary neutron star problem. Moreover, the problem's physical structure has already been explored with different, but limited, techniques. <br/><br/>This project is to combine two sets of techniques (each already developed) and further develop the first set (spectral-tau methods), in order to obtain new results for a leading problem in gravitational wave physics. The PI will develop these mathematical methods by applying them to the specific neutron star problem described above. This strategy of specificity is often used in the development of techniques, which then prove to be more general. Because the scientific problem is of great interest, much is known about it, and results therefore exist withwhich comparisons can be made. These comparisons facilitate the development of mathematical algorithms. Conversely, new mathematical methods deliver more and/or better solutions which enhances scientific understanding."

The research goals of this project are focused on understanding the strong-field regime of Einstein's theory of general relativity. This encompasses both astrophysical and theoretical aspects of general relativity. On the astrophysical side, the main effort is numerical simulation of binary black hole, black hole-neutron star and binary neutron star collisions. This is important to support the nascent field of gravitational wave astronomy that began in 2015 with LIGO's detection of the collision of two black holes. The speed at which the field is advancing is also breathtaking, with the first gravitational wave detection of a binary neutron star collision in 2017, accompanied by intense study of the aftermath across the electromagnetic spectrum by a large community of observational astronomers.  Numerical models of such events are needed to aid in detection, and are crucial to decipher details of what happened. On the theoretical side, there are many outstanding questions about the nature of spacetime in extreme situations. One example is the nature of singularities predicted by Einstein's theory to occur deep in the interior of black holes. Though not thought to be observable as no information can escape from black holes, how general relativity breaks down here is still of keen theoretical interest, as it will give clues to what a putative theory of quantum gravity needs to accomplish to resolve classical singularities. The pursuit of these projects will involve graduate students, undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows. They will be trained to do leading scientific research, become knowledgeable in corresponding areas of physics, and adept in high-performance computing and numerical methods. These skills are invaluable to many professions, and would thus also benefit and further the development of those students and postdocs that subsequently wish to pursue careers outside academia.<br/><br/>A specific list of gravitational wave source modeling projects that will be pursued are (1) understanding the consequences of neutron star spin in binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, (2) developing methods to detect mergers that occur with high orbital eccentricity, (3) using properties of the quasi-normal ringdown of the remnant black holes in binary black hole collisions to test general relativity, in particular the uniqueness properties of black holes, (4) developing models of mergers in certain modified gravity theories to better understand how observations can either rule out such modified scenarios, or detect novel physics beyond general relativity. Regarding black hole interiors, the initial problem will be to study the nature of rotating BTZ (Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli) black holes formed during gravitational collapse in 3-dimensional asymptotically Anti de-Sitter spacetime. This offers a simplified scenario compared to forming Kerr black holes in four-dimensional spacetime, the ultimate goal of this line of research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extreme conditions can be produced in the laboratory - the high-energy particle accelerators are an example - but often only after great investments in both scientific personnel and infrastructure.  For this reason, over the past two decades physicists interested in fundamental physics have increasingly turned to astrophysics, using the exotic conditions already existing in Nature to test the understanding of the underlying laws of physics.  This strategy has proven successful: the high fluxes of neutrinos available from our Sun and cosmic rays led to the discovery of neutrino mass and flavor mixing; studies of the velocities of stars bound in galaxies and galaxy clusters revealed that 85% of the matter in the universe is dark, hidden from us, yet crucial in forming the structures we see in the night sky; observations of the thermonuclear explosions of distant stars led us to conclude that our universe is expanding at an increasing rate, dominated by some mysterious, unidentified vacuum energy; and most recently, a new field of gravitational wave astronomy opened up with Advanced LIGO's detection of the merger of two massive black holes, allowing scientists to test physics in the presence of extreme gravitational fields. This project will bring together nuclear physicists and astrophysicists interested in the quantitative modeling of astrophysical systems, to advance the understanding of the properties of neutrinos, the behavior of nuclear matter at the extremes of temperature and density, and the nature of dark matter.  <br/><br/>The main scientific goal of this project is to produce improved models of extreme astrophysical environments, like the cores of supernovae and the interiors of neutron stars, by combining knowledge of the underlying nuclear and neutrino microphysics, with the most advanced tools for numerical simulations in astrophysics.  This will enable to reliably connect available astrophysical observables, such as the electromagnetic and nucleosynthetic signals from supernovae, to underlying fundamental microphysics.  A second goal is to create the kind of interdisciplinary research environment that will allow the training of a new generation of scientists to work effectively at the interface of astrophysics and fundamental physics.  The nuclear physics community will benefit greatly from junior researchers trained in this interdisciplinary science, who can then bridge the gap between astrophysical and astronomical measurements on one hand, and their interpretation in terms of our ""standard model"" of fundamental interactions, and its possible extensions, on the other."

Novel GW data analysis tools will be developed by adapting promising results from other disciplines. Detector characterization projects will develop sophisticated data mining and automated knowledge discovery tools that will enable GW experimentalists and data analysts to better understand both the detectors and the data.

The recent discovery of gravitational waves from colliding black unveiled a new era of broad opportunities for studying the Cosmos. The coming years will bring about the proliferation of detections of black hole mergers as well as other sources of gravitational waves, including stellar explosions. For every discovery, there will be numerous weak gravitational wave signals buried in the detector noise that will be difficult to unearth. Gravitational-wave detectors are incredibly complex systems, where there are myriads of independent ways noise sources can interfere with the recorded data, occasionally producing curious data artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from gravitational waves. Machine learning is uniquely suited to make sense of this complexity, and disentangle data from the noise to broaden our horizon to detecting gravitational waves.<br/><br/>The PIs will design machine-learning techniques to make sense of LIGO's 400,000 auxiliary data channels and identify patterns in detector behavior to enable the identification of cosmic signals in the midst of highly non-linear and non-Gaussian background noise.
